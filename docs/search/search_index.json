What is PG-Strom? PG-Strom is an extension module of PostgreSQL designed for version 15 or later. By utilization of GPU (Graphic Processor Unit) device which has thousands cores per chip, it enables to accelerate SQL workloads for data analytics or batch processing to big data set. Its core features are GPU code generator that automatically generates GPU program according to the SQL commands and asynchronous parallel execution engine to run SQL workloads on GPU device. The latest version supports SCAN (evaluation of WHERE-clause), JOIN and GROUP BY workloads. In the case when GPU-processing has advantage, PG-Strom replaces the vanilla implementation of PostgreSQL and transparentlly works from users and applications. PG-Strom has two storage options. The first one is the heap storage system of PostgreSQL. It is not always optimal for aggregation / analysis workloads because of its row data format, on the other hands, it has an advantage to run aggregation workloads without data transfer from the transactional database. The other one is Apache Arrow files, that have structured columnar format. Even though it is not suitable for update per row basis, it enables to import large amount of data efficiently, and efficiently search / aggregate the data through foreign data wrapper (FDW). One of the characteristic feature of PG-Strom is GPUDirect SQL that bypasses the CPU/RAM to read the data from NVME / NVME-oF to the GPU directly. SQL processing on the GPU maximizes the bandwidth of these devices. PG-Strom v3.0 newly supports NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage, it allows to support SDS (Software Defined Storage) over the NVME-oF protocol and shared filesystems. The v3.0 newly supports execution of some PostGIS function and GiST index search on the GPU side. Along with the GPU cache, that duplicates the table contents often updated very frequently, it enables search / analysis processing based on the real-time locational information. The v5.0 entirely revised the software architecture design, like update of the process model (multi-process to multi-thread), or switch from the CUDA C++ native code to the portable pseudo code. It improves overall performance and stability. License and Copyright PG-Strom is an open source software distributed under the PostgreSQL License. See LICENSE for the license details.

It collocates date of a row closely, so it works effectively for INSERT/UPDATE-major workloads, but not suitable for summarizing or analytics of mass-data. It is not usual to reference all the columns in a table on mass-data processing, and we tend to reference a part of columns in most cases. In this case, the storage I/O bandwidth consumed by unreferenced columns are waste, however, we have no easy way to fetch only particular columns referenced from the row-oriented data structure. In case of column oriented data structure, in an opposite manner, it has extreme disadvantage on INSERT/UPDATE-major workloads, however, it can pull out maximum performance of storage I/O on mass-data processing workloads because it can loads only referenced columns. From the standpoint of processor efficiency also, column-oriented data structure looks like a flat array that pulls out maximum bandwidth of memory subsystem for GPU, by special memory access pattern called Coalesced Memory Access. What is Apache Arrow? Apache Arrow is a data format of structured data to save in columnar-form and to exchange other applications. Some applications for big-data processing support the format, and it is easy for self-developed applications to use Apache Arrow format since they provides libraries for major programming languages like C,C++ or Python. Apache Arrow format file internally contains Schema portion to define data structure, and one or more RecordBatch to save columnar-data based on the schema definition. For data types, it supports integers, strint (variable-length), date/time types and so on. Indivisual columnar data has its internal representation according to the data types. Data representation in Apache Arrow is not identical with the representation in PostgreSQL. For example, epoch of timestamp in Arrow is 1970-01-01 and it supports multiple precision. In contrast, epoch of timestamp in PostgreSQL is 2001-01-01 and it has microseconds accuracy. Arrow_Fdw allows to read Apache Arrow files on PostgreSQL using foreign table mechanism. If an Arrow file contains 8 of record batches that has million items for each column data, for example, we can access 8 million rows on the Arrow files through the foreign table. Operations Creation of foreign tables Usually it takes the 3 steps below to create a foreign table. Define a foreign-data-wrapper using CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER command Define a foreign server using CREATE SERVER command Define a foreign table using CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command The first 2 steps above are included in the CREATE EXTENSION pg_strom command. All you need to run individually is CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command last. CREATE FOREIGN TABLE flogdata ( ts timestamp, sensor_id int, signal1 smallint, signal2 smallint, signal3 smallint, signal4 smallint, ) SERVER arrow_fdw OPTIONS (file '/path/to/logdata.arrow'); Data type of columns specified by the CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command must be matched to schema definition of the Arrow files to be mapped. Arrow_Fdw also supports a useful manner using IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA statement. It automatically generates a foreign table definition using schema definition of the Arrow files. It specifies the foreign table name, schema name to import, and path name of the Arrow files using OPTION-clause. Schema definition of Arrow files contains data types and optional column name for each column. It declares a new foreign table using these information. IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA flogdata FROM SERVER arrow_fdw INTO public OPTIONS (file '/path/to/logdata.arrow'); Foreign table options Arrow_Fdw supports the options below. Right now, all the options are for foreign tables. file=PATHNAME It maps an Arrow file specified on the foreign table. files=PATHNAME1[,PATHNAME2...] It maps multiple Arrow files specified by comma (,) separated files list on the foreign table. dir=DIRNAME It maps all the Arrow files in the directory specified on the foreign table. suffix=SUFFIX When dir option is given, it maps only files with the specified suffix, like .arrow` for example. parallel_workers=N_WORKERS It tells the number of workers that should be used to assist a parallel scan of this foreign table; equivalent to parallel_workers storage parameter at normal tables. writable=(true|false) It allows execution of INSERT command on the foreign table. See the section of \"Writable Arrow_Fdw\" Data type mapping Arrow data types are mapped on PostgreSQL data types as follows. Int mapped to either of int1 , int2 , int4 or int8 according to the bitWidth attribute. is_signed attribute shall be ignored. int1 is an enhanced data type by PG-Strom. FloatingPoint mapped to either of float2 , float4 or float8 according to the precision attribute. float2 is an enhanced data type by PG-Strom. Binary mapped to bytea data type Decimal mapped to numeric data type Date mapped to date data type; to be adjusted as if it has unit=Day precision. Time mapped to time data type; to be adjusted as if it has unit=MicroSecond precision. Timestamp mapped to timestamp data type; to be adjusted as if it has unit=MicroSecond precision. Interval mapped to interval data type. List mapped to 1-dimensional array of the element data type. Struct mapped to compatible composite data type; that shall be defined preliminary. FixedSizeBinary mapped to char(n) data type according to the byteWidth attribute. If pg_type=TYPENAME is configured, PG-Strom may assign the configured data type. Right now, inet and macaddr are supported. Union , Map , Duration , LargeBinary , LargeUtf8 , LargeList Right now, PG-Strom cannot map these Arrow data types onto any of PostgreSQL data types. How to read EXPLAIN EXPLAIN command show us information about Arrow files reading. The example below is an output of query execution plan that includes f_lineorder foreign table that mapps an Arrow file of 503GB. =# EXPLAIN SELECT sum(lo_extendedprice*lo_discount) as revenue FROM f_lineorder,date1 WHERE lo_orderdate = d_datekey AND d_year = 1993 AND lo_discount between 1 and 3 AND lo_quantity < 25; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aggregate (cost=14535261.08..14535261.09 rows=1 width=8) -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) on f_lineorder (cost=14535261.06..14535261.07 rows=1 width=32) GPU Projection: pgstrom.psum(((f_lineorder.lo_extendedprice * f_lineorder.lo_discount))::bigint) GPU Scan Quals: ((f_lineorder.lo_discount >= 1) AND (f_lineorder.lo_discount <= 3) AND (f_lineorder.lo_quantity < 25)) [rows: 5999990000 -> 9999983] GPU Join Quals [1]: (f_lineorder.lo_orderdate = date1.d_datekey) ...

If multiple files are mapped, any files are individually shown, like file1 , file2 , ... The referenced item shows the list of referenced columns. We can see this query touches lo_orderdate , lo_quantity , lo_extendedprice and lo_discount columns. In addition, GPU-Direct SQL: enabled (GPU-0) shows us the scan on f_lineorder uses GPU-Direct SQL mechanism. VERBOSE option outputs more detailed information. =# EXPLAIN VERBOSE SELECT sum(lo_extendedprice*lo_discount) as revenue FROM f_lineorder,date1 WHERE lo_orderdate = d_datekey AND d_year = 1993 AND lo_discount between 1 and 3 AND lo_quantity < 25; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aggregate (cost=14535261.08..14535261.09 rows=1 width=8) Output: pgstrom.sum_int((pgstrom.psum(((f_lineorder.lo_extendedprice * f_lineorder.lo_discount))::bigint))) -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) on public.f_lineorder (cost=14535261.06..14535261.07 rows=1 width=32) Output: (pgstrom.psum(((f_lineorder.lo_extendedprice * f_lineorder.lo_discount))::bigint)) GPU Projection: pgstrom.psum(((f_lineorder.lo_extendedprice * f_lineorder.lo_discount))::bigint) GPU Scan Quals: ((f_lineorder.lo_discount >= 1) AND (f_lineorder.lo_discount <= 3) AND (f_lineorder.lo_quantity < 25)) [rows: 5999990000 -> 9999983] GPU Join Quals [1]: (f_lineorder.lo_orderdate = date1.d_datekey) ...

The load of lo_orderdate , lo_quantity , lo_extendedprice and lo_discount columns needs to read 89.41GB in total. It is 17.8% towards the filesize (502.93GB). How to make Arrow files This section introduces the way to transform dataset already stored in PostgreSQL database system into Apache Arrow file. Using PyArrow+Pandas A pair of PyArrow module, developed by Arrow developers community, and Pandas data frame can dump PostgreSQL database into an Arrow file. The example below reads all the data in table t0 , then write out them into /tmp/t0.arrow . import pyarrow as pa import pandas as pd X = pd.read_sql(sql=\"SELECT * FROM t0\", con=\"postgresql://localhost/postgres\") Y = pa.Table.from_pandas(X) f = pa.RecordBatchFileWriter('/tmp/t0.arrow', Y.schema) f.write_table(Y,1000000) # RecordBatch for each million rows f.close() Please note that the above operation once keeps query result of the SQL on memory, so should pay attention on memory consumption if you want to transfer massive rows at once. Using Pg2Arrow On the other hand, pg2arrow command, developed by PG-Strom Development Team, enables us to write out query result into Arrow file. This tool is designed to write out massive amount of data into storage device like NVME-SSD. It fetch query results from PostgreSQL database system, and write out Record Batches of Arrow format for each data size specified by the -s|--segment-size option. Thus, its memory consumption is relatively reasonable. pg2arrow command is distributed with PG-Strom. It shall be installed on the bin directory of PostgreSQL related utilities. $ pg2arrow --help Usage: pg2arrow [OPTION] [database] [username] General options: -d, --dbname=DBNAME Database name to connect to -c, --command=COMMAND SQL command to run -t, --table=TABLENAME Equivalent to '-c SELECT * FROM TABLENAME' (-c and -t are exclusive, either of them must be given) --inner-join=SUB_COMMAND --outer-join=SUB_COMMAND -o, --output=FILENAME result file in Apache Arrow format --append=FILENAME result Apache Arrow file to be appended (--output and --append are exclusive. If neither of them are given, it creates a temporary file.) -S, --stat[=COLUMNS] embeds min/max statistics for each record batch COLUMNS is a comma-separated list of the target columns if partially enabled. Arrow format options: -s, --segment-size=SIZE size of record batch for each Connection options: -h, --host=HOSTNAME database server host -p, --port=PORT database server port -u, --user=USERNAME database user name -w, --no-password never prompt for password -W, --password force password prompt Other options: --dump=FILENAME dump information of arrow file --progress shows progress of the job --set=NAME:VALUE config option to set before SQL execution --help shows this message Report bugs to <pgstrom@heterodbcom>. The -h or -U option specifies the connection parameters of PostgreSQL, like psql or pg_dump . The simplest usage of this command is running a SQL command specified by -c|--command option on PostgreSQL server, then write out results into the file specified by -o|--output option in Arrow format. --append option is available, instead of -o|--output option. It means appending data to existing Apache Arrow file. In this case, the target Apache Arrow file must have fully identical schema definition towards the specified SQL command. The example below reads all the data in table t0 , then write out them into the file /tmp/t0.arrow . $ pg2arrow -U kaigai -d postgres -c \"SELECT * FROM t0\" -o /tmp/t0.arrow Although it is an option for developers, --dump <filename> prints schema definition and record-batch location and size of Arrow file in human readable form. --progress option enables to show progress of the task. It is useful when a huge table is transformed to Apache Arrow format. Advanced Usage SSDtoGPU Direct SQL In case when all the Arrow files mapped on the Arrow_Fdw foreign table satisfies the terms below, PG-Strom enables SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL to load columnar data. Arrow files are on NVME-SSD volume. NVME-SSD volume is managed by Ext4 filesystem. Total size of Arrow files exceeds the pg_strom.nvme_strom_threshold configuration. Partition configuration Arrow_Fdw foreign tables can be used as a part of partition leafs. Usual PostgreSQL tables can be mixtured with Arrow_Fdw foreign tables. So, pay attention Arrow_Fdw foreign table does not support any writer operations. And, make boundary condition of the partition consistent to the contents of the mapped Arrow file. It is a responsibility of the database administrators. A typical usage scenario is processing of long-standing accumulated log-data. Unlike transactional data, log-data is mostly write-once and will never be updated / deleted. Thus, by migration of the log-data after a lapse of certain period into Arrow_Fdw foreign table that is read-only but rapid processing, we can accelerate summarizing and analytics workloads. In addition, log-data likely have timestamp, so it is quite easy design to add partition leafs periodically, like monthly, weekly or others. The example below defines a partitioned table that mixes a normal PostgreSQL table and Arrow_Fdw foreign tables.

In case of column oriented data structure, in an opposite manner, it has extreme disadvantage on INSERT/UPDATE-major workloads, however, it can pull out maximum performance of storage I/O on mass-data processing workloads because it can loads only referenced columns.

Some applications for big-data processing support the format, and it is easy for self-developed applications to use Apache Arrow format since they provides libraries for major programming languages like C,C++ or Python. Apache Arrow format file internally contains Schema portion to define data structure, and one or more RecordBatch to save columnar-data based on the schema definition. For data types, it supports integers, strint (variable-length), date/time types and so on. Indivisual columnar data has its internal representation according to the data types. Data representation in Apache Arrow is not identical with the representation in PostgreSQL. For example, epoch of timestamp in Arrow is 1970-01-01 and it supports multiple precision. In contrast, epoch of timestamp in PostgreSQL is 2001-01-01 and it has microseconds accuracy. Arrow_Fdw allows to read Apache Arrow files on PostgreSQL using foreign table mechanism.

Overview In the technological domain known as IoT/M2M, various software has been developed to store and analyze the large amount of log data generated by devices such as cell phones, automobiles, and various sensors, as well as PCs and servers. This is because the data generated by a large number of devices from time-by-time tend to grow up huge, and special architecture/technology is required to process it in a practical amount of time. PG-Strom's features are designed and implemented for high-speed processing of log data of such a scale. On the other hand, it tends to be a time-consuming job to transfer and import these data into a database in order to make it searchable/summarizable on such a scale. Therefore, PG-Strom includes a fluent-plugin-arrow-file module for Fluentd that outputs the data in Apache Arrow format, and tries to deal with the problem. Fluentd is a log collection tool developed by Sadayuki Furuhashi. It is the de facto standard for collecting and storing a wide variety of log data, ranging from server logs like Syslog to device logs of IoT/M2M devices. Fluentd allows customization of the input/output and processing of log data by adding plugins written in Ruby. As of 2022, more than 800 plugins have been introduced on the official website. PG-Strom can handle two types of data formats: PostgreSQL Heap format (transactional row data) and Apache Arrow format (structured column data). The Apache Arrow format is suitable for workloads like those in the IoT/M2M, where huge amounts of data are generated time-by-time. arrow-file plugin This chapter describes the approach to write out the log data collected by Fluentd in Apache Arrow format, and to refere it with PG-Strom. We assume td-agent here, that is a stable version of Fluentd provided by Treasure Data. PG-Strom includes the fluent-plugin-arrow-file module. This allows Fluentd to write out the log data it collects as an Apache Arrow format file with a specified schema structure. Using PG-Strom's Arrow_Fdw, this Apache Arrow format file can be accessed as an foreign table. In addition, GPU-Direct SQL allows to load these files extremely fast, if the storage system is appropriately configured. This has the following advantages: There is no need to import data into the DB because PG-Strom directly accesses the files output by Fluentd. The data readout (I/O load) for the searching and summarizing process can be kept to a minimum because of the columnar data format. You can archive outdated log data only by moving files on the OS. On the other hand, in cases that it takes a long time to store a certain size of log (for example, log generation is rare), another method such as outputting to a PostgreSQL table is suitable for more real-time log analysis. This is because the size of the Record Batch needs to be reasonably large to acquire the performance benefits of the Apache Arrow format. Internals There are several types of plugins for Fluentd: Input plugins to receive logs from outside, Parser plugins to shape the logs, Buffer plugins to temporarily store the received logs, and Output plugins to output the logs. The arrow-file plugin is categorized as Output plugin. It writes out a \"chunk\" of log data passed from the Buffer plugin in Apache Arrow format with the schema structure specified in the configuration. The Input/Parser plugin is responsible for converting the received logs into a common format so that the Buffer and Output plugins can handle the input data without being aware of its format. The common format is a pair of tag , an identifier that can be used to sort the logs, a log timestamp time , and record , an associative array formed from the raw logs. The arrow-file plugin writes to an Apache Arrow format file with the tag and time fields and each element of the record associative array as a column (some may be omitted). Therefore, the output destination file name and schema definition information (mapping of associative array elements to columns/types) are mandatory configuration parameters. Installation Install the td-agent package for Linux distribution you are using. The rake-compiler module is required to install the arrow-file plugin, so please install it before. $ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent4.sh | sh $ sudo /opt/td-agent/bin/fluent-gem install rake-compiler Next, download the source code for PG-Strom and build arrow-file plugin in the fluentd directory. $ git clone https://github.com/heterodb/pg-strom.git $ cd pg-strom/fluentd $ make TD_AGENT=1 gem $ sudo make TD_AGENT=1 install To confirm that the Fluentd plugin is installed, run the following command. $ /opt/td-agent/bin/fluent-gem list | grep arrow fluent-plugin-arrow-file (0.2) Configuration As mentioned above, the arrow-file plugin requires the output path of the file and the schema definition at least. In addition to this, in order to acquire the best performance for searching and aggregation processing, the single chunk of data inside the Apache Arrow file, called the Record Batch, needs to be reasonably large in size. The arrow-file plugin creates a Record Batch for each chunk passed from the Buffer plugin. Therefore, the buffer size of the Buffer plugin should be set with the size of the Record Batch in mind. By the default, the Buffer plugin is set to take a buffer size of 256MB. The configuration parameters for the arrow-file plugin are as follows: path [type: String ] (Required) Specify the file path of the destination. This is a required parameter, and you can use placeholders shown below. Placeholders Description %Y The current year expressed as a four-digit number. %y The current year expressed as a number in the last two digits of the year. %m A two-digit number representing the current month, 01-12. %d A two-digit number representing the current day from 01 to 31. %H A two-digit number representing the hour of the current time 00-23. %M A two-digit number representing the minute of the current time, 00-59. %S A two-digit number representing the second of the current time, 00-59. %p The PID of the current Fluentd process. The placeholder is replaced when the chunk is written out. If an Apache Arrow format file of the same name exists, the Record Batch will be appended to it. If it does not exist, a new Apache Arrow format file is created and the first Record Batch is written out. However, if the size of the existing Apache Arrow file exceeds the filesize_threshold setting described below, rename the existing file and then create a new one. (Example) path /tmp/arrow_logs/my_logs_%y%m%d.%p.log The output Apache Arrow file updates the footer area to point to all Record Batches each time a chunk is written out. Therefore, the generated Apache Arrow file can be read immediately. However, to avoid access conflicts, exclusive handling is required using lockf(3) . schema_defs [type: String ] (Required) Specify the schema definition of the Apache Arrow format file output by fluent-plugin-arrow-file . This is a required parameter, and define the schema structure using strings in the following format. schema_defs := column_def1[,column_def2 ...] column_def := <column_name>=<column_type>[;<column_attrs>] <column_name> is the name of the column, which must match the key value of the associative array passed from Fluentd to arrow-file plugin. <column_type> is the data type of the column. See the following table. <column_attrs> is an additional attribute for columns. At this time, only the following attributes are supported. stat_enabled ... The statistics for the configured columns will be collected and the maximum/minimum values for each Record Batch will be set as custom metadata in the form of max_values=... and min_values=... . (Example) schema_defs \"ts=Timestamp;stat_enabled,dev_id=Uint32,temperature=Float32,humidity=Float32\" Data types supported by the arrow-file plugin Data types Description Int8 Int16 Int32 Int64 Signed integer with the specified bit width. Uint8 Uint16 Uint32 Uint64 Unsigned integer with the specified bit width Float16 Float32 Float64 Floating point number with half-precision(16bit), single-precision(32bit) and double-precision(64bit). Decimal Decimal128 128-bit fixed decimal; 256-bit fixed decimal is currently not supported. Timestamp Timestamp[sec] Timestamp[ms] Timestamp[us] Timestamp[ns] Timestamp type with the specified precision. If the precision is omitted, it is treated the same as [us] . Time Time[sec] Time[ms] Time[us] Time[ns] Time type with the specified precision. If the precision is omitted, it is treated the same as [sec] . Date Date[Day] Date[ms] Date type with the specified precision. If the precision is omitted, it is treated the same as [day] . Utf8 String type. Ipaddr4 IP address(IPv4) type. This is represented as a FixedSizeBinary type with byteWidth=4 and custom metadata pg_type=pg_catalog.inet . Ipaddr6 IP address(IPv6) type. This is represented as a FixedSizeBinary type with byteWidth=16 and custom metadata pg_type=pg_catalog.inet . ts_column [type: String / default: unspecified] Specify a column name to set the timestamp value of the log passed from Fluentd (not from record ). This parameter is usually a date-time type such as Timestamp , and the stat_enabled attribute should also be specified to achieve fast search. tag_column [type: String / default: unspecified] Specify a column name to set the tag value of the log passed from Fluentd (not from record ). This parameter is usually a string type such as utf8 . filesize_threshold [type: Integer / default: 10000] Specify the threshold for switching the output destination file in MB. By default, the output destination is switched when the file size exceeds about 10GB. Example As a simple example, this chapter shows a configuration for monitoring the log of a local Apache Httpd server, parsing it field by field, and writing it to an Apache Arrow format file. By setting <source> , /var/log/httpd/access_log will be the data source. Then, the apache2 Parse plugin will cut out the fields: host, user, time, method, path, code, size, referer, agent. The fields are then passed to the arrow-file plugin as an associative array. In schema_defs in <match> , the column definitions of the Apache Arrow file corresponding to the fields are set.

This is because the data generated by a large number of devices from time-by-time tend to grow up huge, and special architecture/technology is required to process it in a practical amount of time. PG-Strom's features are designed and implemented for high-speed processing of log data of such a scale. On the other hand, it tends to be a time-consuming job to transfer and import these data into a database in order to make it searchable/summarizable on such a scale. Therefore, PG-Strom includes a fluent-plugin-arrow-file module for Fluentd that outputs the data in Apache Arrow format, and tries to deal with the problem. Fluentd is a log collection tool developed by Sadayuki Furuhashi. It is the de facto standard for collecting and storing a wide variety of log data, ranging from server logs like Syslog to device logs of IoT/M2M devices. Fluentd allows customization of the input/output and processing of log data by adding plugins written in Ruby. As of 2022, more than 800 plugins have been introduced on the official website. PG-Strom can handle two types of data formats: PostgreSQL Heap format (transactional row data) and Apache Arrow format (structured column data). The Apache Arrow format is suitable for workloads like those in the IoT/M2M, where huge amounts of data are generated time-by-time.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"fluentd/#arrow-file-plugin","text":"This chapter describes the approach to write out the log data collected by Fluentd in Apache Arrow format, and to refere it with PG-Strom. We assume td-agent here, that is a stable version of Fluentd provided by Treasure Data. PG-Strom includes the fluent-plugin-arrow-file module. This allows Fluentd to write out the log data it collects as an Apache Arrow format file with a specified schema structure. Using PG-Strom's Arrow_Fdw, this Apache Arrow format file can be accessed as an foreign table. In addition, GPU-Direct SQL allows to load these files extremely fast, if the storage system is appropriately configured. This has the following advantages: There is no need to import data into the DB because PG-Strom directly accesses the files output by Fluentd. The data readout (I/O load) for the searching and summarizing process can be kept to a minimum because of the columnar data format. You can archive outdated log data only by moving files on the OS. On the other hand, in cases that it takes a long time to store a certain size of log (for example, log generation is rare), another method such as outputting to a PostgreSQL table is suitable for more real-time log analysis.

The Input/Parser plugin is responsible for converting the received logs into a common format so that the Buffer and Output plugins can handle the input data without being aware of its format. The common format is a pair of tag , an identifier that can be used to sort the logs, a log timestamp time , and record , an associative array formed from the raw logs. The arrow-file plugin writes to an Apache Arrow format file with the tag and time fields and each element of the record associative array as a column (some may be omitted).

In addition to this, in order to acquire the best performance for searching and aggregation processing, the single chunk of data inside the Apache Arrow file, called the Record Batch, needs to be reasonably large in size. The arrow-file plugin creates a Record Batch for each chunk passed from the Buffer plugin. Therefore, the buffer size of the Buffer plugin should be set with the size of the Record Batch in mind. By the default, the Buffer plugin is set to take a buffer size of 256MB. The configuration parameters for the arrow-file plugin are as follows: path [type: String ] (Required) Specify the file path of the destination. This is a required parameter, and you can use placeholders shown below. Placeholders Description %Y The current year expressed as a four-digit number. %y The current year expressed as a number in the last two digits of the year. %m A two-digit number representing the current month, 01-12. %d A two-digit number representing the current day from 01 to 31. %H A two-digit number representing the hour of the current time 00-23. %M A two-digit number representing the minute of the current time, 00-59. %S A two-digit number representing the second of the current time, 00-59. %p The PID of the current Fluentd process. The placeholder is replaced when the chunk is written out. If an Apache Arrow format file of the same name exists, the Record Batch will be appended to it. If it does not exist, a new Apache Arrow format file is created and the first Record Batch is written out. However, if the size of the existing Apache Arrow file exceeds the filesize_threshold setting described below, rename the existing file and then create a new one. (Example) path /tmp/arrow_logs/my_logs_%y%m%d.%p.log The output Apache Arrow file updates the footer area to point to all Record Batches each time a chunk is written out. Therefore, the generated Apache Arrow file can be read immediately. However, to avoid access conflicts, exclusive handling is required using lockf(3) . schema_defs [type: String ] (Required) Specify the schema definition of the Apache Arrow format file output by fluent-plugin-arrow-file . This is a required parameter, and define the schema structure using strings in the following format. schema_defs := column_def1[,column_def2 ...] column_def := <column_name>=<column_type>[;<column_attrs>] <column_name> is the name of the column, which must match the key value of the associative array passed from Fluentd to arrow-file plugin. <column_type> is the data type of the column.

The same is true when PG-Strom processes SQL queries on the GPU. Internally, the records read from the PostgreSQL table are transferred to the GPU, and then various SQL operations are executed on the GPU. However, these processes take time to read the tables and transfer the data. (In many cases, much longer than the processing on the GPU!) GPU Cache is a function that reserves an area on the GPU device memory in advance and keeps a copy of the PostgreSQL table there. This can be used to execute search/analysis SQL in real time for data that is relatively small(~10GB) and is frequently updated. The log-based synchronization mechanism described below allows GPU Cache to be kept up-to-date without interfering with highly parallel and transactional workloads. Nevertheless, you can process search/analytical SQL workloads on data already loaded on GPU Cache without reading the records from the table again or transferring the data over the PCI-E bus. A typical use case of GPU Cache is to join location data, such as the current position of a mobile device like a car or a cell phone, collected in real time with other data using GPU-PostGIS . The workload of updating location information sent out by many devices is extremely heavy. However, it also needs to be applied on the GPU side without delay in order to perform search/analysis queries based on the latest location information. Although the size is limited, GPU Cache is one option to achieve both high frequency updates and high-performance search/analysis query execution. Architecture GPU Caches needs to satisfy two requirements: highly parallel update-based workloads and search/analytical queries on constantly up-to-date data. In many systems, the CPU and GPU are connected via the PCI-E bus, and there is a reasonable delay in their communication. Therefore, synchronizing GPU Cache every time a row is updated in the target table will significantly degrade the transaction performance. Using GPU Cache allocates a \"REDO Log Buffer\" on the shared memory on the host side in addition to the area on the memory of the GPU. When a SQL command (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is executed to update a table, the updated contents are copied to the REDO Log Buffer by the AFTER ROW trigger. Since this process can be completed by CPU and RAM alone without any GPU call, it has little impact on transaction performance. When a certain amount of unapplied REDO Log Entries accumulate in the REDO Log Buffer, or a certain amount of time has passed since the last write, it is loaded by a background worker process (GPU memory keeper) and applied to GPU Cache. At this time, REDO Log Entries are transferred to the GPU in batches and processed in parallel by thousands of processor cores on the GPU, so delays caused by this process are rarely a problem. Search/analysis queries against the target table in GPU Cache do not load the table data, but use the data mapped from GPU Cache pre-allocated on the GPU device memory. If there are any unapplied REDO Logs at the start of the search/analysis query, they will all be applied to GPU Cache. This means that the results of a search/analysis query scanning the target GPU Cache will return the same results as if it were referring to the table directly, and the query will always be consistent. Configuration To enable GPU Cache, configure a trigger that executes pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger() function on AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE for each row. If GPU Cache is used on the replication slave, the invocation mode of this trigger must be ALWAYS . Below is an example to configure GPU Cache on the dpoints table. =# create trigger row_sync after insert or update or delete on dpoints_even for row execute function pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger(); =# alter table dpoints_even enable always trigger row_sync; Note Additional configuration at PostgreSQL v12 or prior. In case when GPU Cache is used at PostgreSQL v12 or prior, you need to configure an additional BEFORE TRUNCATE statement trigger that executes pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger() function. If you want to use the GPU Cache on the replication slave, If you use GPU Cache at the PostgreSQL v12 or prior, in a similar way, invocation mode of this trigger must have ALWAYS . PostgreSQL v13 enhanced its object-access-hook mechanism, so allows extension modules to capture execution of TRUNCATE without triggers configuration. On the other hand, the prior version still needs the BEFORE TRUNCATE statement trigger to keep consistency of GPU Cache by capture of TRUNCATE. Below is an example to configure GPU Cache on the dpoints table at PostgreSQL v12 or prior. =# create trigger row_sync after insert or update or delete on dpoints_even for row execute function pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger(); =# create trigger stmt_sync before truncate on dpoints_even for statement execute function pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger(); =# alter table dpoints_even enable always trigger row_sync; =# alter table dpoints_even enable always trigger stmt_sync; GPU Cache Customize You can customize GPU Cache by specifying an optional string in the form of KEY=VALUE as an argument to GPU Cache line trigger. Please note that where you should specify is not to the syntax trigger. The following SQL statement is an example of creating a GPU Cache whose maximum row count is 2.5 million rows and the size of the REDO Log Buffer is 100MB. =# create trigger row_sync after insert or update or delete on dpoints_even for row execute function pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger('max_num_rows=2500000,redo_buffer_size=100m'); The options that can be given to the argument of the line trigger are shown below. gpu_device_id=GPU_ID (default: 0) Specify the target GPU device ID to allocate GPU Cache. max_num_rows=NROWS (default: 10485760) Specify the number of rows that can be allocated on GPU Cache. Just as with PostgreSQL tables, GPU Cache needs to retain updated rows prior to commit for visibility control, so max_num_rows should be specified with some margin. Note that the old version of the updated/deleted row will be released after the transaction is committed. redo_buffer_size=SIZE (default: 160m) Specify the size of REDO Log Buffer. You can use k, m and g as the unit. gpu_sync_interval=SECONDS (default: 5) If the specified time has passed since the last write to the REDO Log Buffer, REDO Log will be applied to the GPU, regardless of the number of rows updated. gpu_sync_threshold=SIZE (default: 25% of redo_buffer_size ) When the unapplied REDO Log in the REDO Log Buffer reaches SIZE bytes, it is applied to the GPU side. You can use k, m and g as the unit. GPU Cache Options Below are GPU Cache related PostgreSQL configuration parameters. pg_strom.enable_gpucache (default: on) This option controls whether search/analytical queries will use GPU Cache or not. If this value is off, the data will be read from the table each time, ignoring GPU Cache even if it is available. Note that this setting has no effect on REDO Log Buffer appending by triggers. pg_strom.gpucache_auto_preload (default: NULL) When PostgreSQL is started/restarted, GPU Cache for the table specified by this parameter will be built in advance. The value should be in the format: DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME . To specify multiple tables, separate them by commas. If GPU Cache is not built, the PostgreSQL backend process that first attempts to access GPU Cache will scan the entire target table and transfer it to the GPU. This process usually takes a considerable amount of time. However, by specifying the tables that should be loaded in this option, you can avoid waiting too long the first time you run a search/analysis query. If this parameter is set to '*', it will attempt to load the contents of all tables with GPU Cache into the GPU in order. At this time, the background worker will access all the databases in order, and will return exit code 1 to prompt the postmaster to restart. The server startup log will show that the \"GPUCache Startup Preloader\" exited with exit code 1 as follows, but this is not abnormal. LOG: database system is ready to accept connections LOG: background worker \"GPUCache Startup Preloader\" (PID 856418) exited with exit code 1 LOG: background worker \"GPUCache Startup Preloader\" (PID 856427) exited with exit code 1 LOG: create GpuCacheSharedState dpoints:164c95f71 LOG: gpucache: AllocMemory dpoints:164c95f71 (main_sz=772505600, extra_sz=0) LOG: gpucache: auto preload 'public.dpoints' (DB: postgres) LOG: create GpuCacheSharedState mytest:1773a589b LOG: gpucache: auto preload 'public.mytest' (DB: postgres) LOG: gpucache: AllocMemory mytest:1773a589b (main_sz=675028992, extra_sz=0) Operations Confirm GPU Cache usage GPU Cache is referred to transparently. The user does not need to be aware of the presence or absence of GPU Cache, and PG-Strom will automatically determine and switch the process. The following is the query plan for a query that refers to the table \"dpoints\" which has GPU Cache set. The 3rd row from the bottom, in the \"GPU Cache\" field, shows the basic information about GPU Cache of this table. We can see that the query is executed with referring to GPU Cache and not the \"dpoints\" table. Note that the meaning of each item is as follows: max_num_rows indicates the maximum number of rows that GPU Cache can hold; main indicates the size of the area in GPU Cache for fixed-length fields; extra indicates the size of the area for variable-length data. =# explain select pref, city, count(*) from giscity g, dpoints d where pref = 'Tokyo' and st_contains(g.geom,st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) group by pref, city; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HashAggregate (cost=5638809.75..5638859.99 rows=5024 width=29) Group Key: g.pref, g.city -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=5638696.71..5638759.51 rows=5024 width=29) Reduction: Local Combined GpuJoin: enabled GPU Preference: GPU0 (NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on dpoints d (cost=631923.57..5606933.23 rows=50821573 width=21) Outer Scan: dpoints d (cost=0.00..141628.18 rows=7999618 width=16) Depth 1: GpuGiSTJoin(nrows 7999618...50821573) HeapSize: 3251.36KB IndexFilter: (g.geom ~ st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) on giscity_geom_idx JoinQuals: st_contains(g.geom, st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) GPU Preference: GPU0 (NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) GPU Cache: NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB [max_num_rows: 12000000, main: 772.51M, extra: 0] -> Seq Scan on giscity g (cost=0.00..8929.24 rows=6353 width=1883) Filter: ((pref)::text = 'Tokyo'::text) (16 rows) Check status of GPU Cache Use the pgstrom.gpucache_info view to check the current state of GPU Cache. =# select * from pgstrom.gpucache_info ; database_oid | database_name | table_oid | table_name | signature | refcnt | corrupted | gpu_main_sz | gpu_extra_sz | redo_write_ts | redo_write_nitems | redo_write_pos | redo_read_nitems | redo_read_pos | redo_sync_pos | config_options --------------+---------------+-----------+------------+------------+--------+-----------+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+-------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 12728 | postgres | 25244 | mytest | 6295279771 | 3 | f | 675028992 | 0 | 2021-05-14 03:00:18.623503 | 500000 | 36000000 | 500000 | 36000000 | 36000000 | gpu_device_id=0,max_num_rows=10485760,redo_buffer_size=167772160,gpu_sync_interval=5000000,gpu_sync_threshold=41943040 12728 | postgres | 25262 | dpoints | 5985886065 | 3 | f | 772505600 | 0 | 2021-05-14 03:00:18.524627 | 8000000 | 576000192 | 8000000 | 576000192 | 576000192 | gpu_device_id=0,max_num_rows=12000000,redo_buffer_size=167772160,gpu_sync_interval=5000000,gpu_sync_threshold=41943040 (2 rows) Note that pgstrom.gpucache_info will only show the status of GPU Caches that have been initially loaded and have space allocated on the GPU device memory at that time. In other words, if the trigger function is set but not yet initially loaded (no one has accessed it yet), the potentially allocated GPU Cache will not be shown yet.

It does not always reflect the latest value. corrupted Shows whether the GPU Cache is corrupted. gpu_main_sz The size of the area reserved in GPU Cache for fixed-length data. gpu_extra_sz The size of the area reserved in GPU Cache for variable-length data. redo_write_ts The time when the REDO Log Buffer was last updated. redo_write_nitems The total number of REDO Logs in the REDO Log Buffer. redo_write_pos The total size (in bytes) of the REDO Logs in the REDO Log Buffer. redo_read_nitems The total number of REDO Logs read from the REDO Log Buffer and applied to the GPU. redo_read_pos The total size (in bytes) of REDO Logs read from the REDO Log Buffer and applied to the GPU. redo_sync_pos The position of the REDO Log which is scheduled to be applied to GPU Cache by the background worker on the REDO Log Buffer. This is used internally to avoid a situation where many sessions generate asynchronous requests at the same time when the remaining REDO Log Buffer is running out. config_options The optional string to customize GPU Cache. GPU Cache corruption and recovery If and when REDO logs could not be applied on the GPU cache by some reasons, like insertion of more rows than the max_num_rows configuration, or too much consumption of variable-length data buffer, GPU cache moves to the \"corrupted\" state. Once GPU cache gets corrupted, search/analysis SQL does not reference the GPU cache, and table updates stops writing REDO log. (If GPU cache gets corrupted after beginning of a search/analysis SQL unfortunately, this query may raise an error.) The pgstrom.gpucache_recovery(regclass) function recovers the GPU cache from the corrupted state. If you run this function after removal of the cause where REDO logs could not be applied, it runs initial-loading of the GPU cache again, then tries to recover the GPU cache. For example, if GPU cache gets corrupted because you tried to insert more rows than the max_num_rows , you reconfigure the trigger with expanded max_num_rows configuration or you delete a part of rows from the table, then runs pgstrom.gpucache_recovery() function.","title":"GPU Cache"},{"location":"gpucache/#gpu-cache","text":"","title":"GPU Cache"},{"location":"gpucache/#overview","text":"GPU has a device memory that is independent of the RAM in the host system, and in order to calculate on the GPU, data must be transferred from the host system or storage device to the GPU device memory once through the PCI-E bus. The same is true when PG-Strom processes SQL queries on the GPU. Internally, the records read from the PostgreSQL table are transferred to the GPU, and then various SQL operations are executed on the GPU. However, these processes take time to read the tables and transfer the data. (In many cases, much longer than the processing on the GPU!) GPU Cache is a function that reserves an area on the GPU device memory in advance and keeps a copy of the PostgreSQL table there. This can be used to execute search/analysis SQL in real time for data that is relatively small(~10GB) and is frequently updated. The log-based synchronization mechanism described below allows GPU Cache to be kept up-to-date without interfering with highly parallel and transactional workloads. Nevertheless, you can process search/analytical SQL workloads on data already loaded on GPU Cache without reading the records from the table again or transferring the data over the PCI-E bus. A typical use case of GPU Cache is to join location data, such as the current position of a mobile device like a car or a cell phone, collected in real time with other data using GPU-PostGIS . The workload of updating location information sent out by many devices is extremely heavy. However, it also needs to be applied on the GPU side without delay in order to perform search/analysis queries based on the latest location information. Although the size is limited, GPU Cache is one option to achieve both high frequency updates and high-performance search/analysis query execution.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"gpucache/#architecture","text":"GPU Caches needs to satisfy two requirements: highly parallel update-based workloads and search/analytical queries on constantly up-to-date data. In many systems, the CPU and GPU are connected via the PCI-E bus, and there is a reasonable delay in their communication. Therefore, synchronizing GPU Cache every time a row is updated in the target table will significantly degrade the transaction performance. Using GPU Cache allocates a \"REDO Log Buffer\" on the shared memory on the host side in addition to the area on the memory of the GPU. When a SQL command (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is executed to update a table, the updated contents are copied to the REDO Log Buffer by the AFTER ROW trigger. Since this process can be completed by CPU and RAM alone without any GPU call, it has little impact on transaction performance. When a certain amount of unapplied REDO Log Entries accumulate in the REDO Log Buffer, or a certain amount of time has passed since the last write, it is loaded by a background worker process (GPU memory keeper) and applied to GPU Cache. At this time, REDO Log Entries are transferred to the GPU in batches and processed in parallel by thousands of processor cores on the GPU, so delays caused by this process are rarely a problem. Search/analysis queries against the target table in GPU Cache do not load the table data, but use the data mapped from GPU Cache pre-allocated on the GPU device memory. If there are any unapplied REDO Logs at the start of the search/analysis query, they will all be applied to GPU Cache. This means that the results of a search/analysis query scanning the target GPU Cache will return the same results as if it were referring to the table directly, and the query will always be consistent.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"gpucache/#configuration","text":"To enable GPU Cache, configure a trigger that executes pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger() function on AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE for each row.

GPU Direct SQL Execution needs NVME-SSD devices, or fast network card with RoCE support, and to be installed under the same PCIe Root Complex where GPU is located on. GPU Device PG-Strom requires at least one GPU device on the system, which is supported by CUDA Toolkit, has computing capability 6.0 (Pascal generation) or later; Please check at 002: HW Validation List - List of supported GPU models for GPU selection. Operating System PG-Strom requires Linux operating system for x86_64 architecture, and its distribution supported by CUDA Toolkit. Our recommendation is Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Rocky Linux version 8.x series. GPU Direct SQL (with cuFile driver) needs the nvidia-fs driver distributed with CUDA Toolkit, and Mellanox OFED (OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution) driver. PostgreSQL PG-Strom v5.0 requires PostgreSQL v15 or later. Some of PostgreSQL APIs used by PG-Strom internally are not included in the former versions.

Disables nouveau driver When the nouveau driver, that is an open source compatible driver for NVIDIA GPUs, is loaded, it prevent to load the nvidia driver. In this case, reboot the operating system after a configuration to disable the nouveau driver. To disable the nouveau driver, put the following configuration onto /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nouveau.conf , and run dracut command to apply them on the boot image of Linux kernel. Then, restart the system once. # cat > /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nouveau.conf <<EOF blacklist nouveau options nouveau modeset=0 EOF # dracut -f # shutdown -r now Disables IOMMU GPU-Direct SQL uses GPUDirect Storage (cuFile) API of CUDA.

Configure the kernel boot option according to the NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage Installation and Troubleshooting Guide description. To disable IOMMU, add amd_iommu=off (for AMD CPU) or intel_iommu=off (for Intel CPU) to the kernel boot options. Configuration at RHEL9 The command below adds the kernel boot option. # grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args=\"amd_iommu=off\" Configuration at RHEL8 Open /etc/default/grub with an editor and add the above option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= line. For example, the settings should look like this: } : GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"rhgb quiet amd_iommu=off\" : Run the following commands to apply the configuration to the kernel bool options. # update-grub # shutdown -r now Enables extra repositories EPEL(Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) Several software modules required by PG-Strom are distributed as a part of EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux). You need to add a repository definition of EPEL packages for yum system to obtain these software. One of the package we will get from EPEL repository is DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support). It is a framework to build Linux kernel module for the running Linux kernel on demand; used for NVIDIA's GPU driver and related. Linux kernel module must be rebuilt according to version-up of Linux kernel, so we don't recommend to operate the system without DKMS. epel-release package provides the repository definition of EPEL. You can obtain the package from the Fedora Project website. -- For RHEL9 # dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm -- For RHEL8 # dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm -- For Rocky8/Rocky9 # dnf install epel-release Red Hat CodeReady Linux Builder Installation of MOFED (Mellanox OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution) driver requires the Red Hat CodeReady Linux Builder repository which is disabled in the default configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x installation. In Rocky Linux, it is called PowerTools To enable this repository, run the command below: -- For RHEL9 # subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms -- For Rocky9 # dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb -- For RHEL8 # subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms -- For Rocky8 # dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools MOFED Driver Installation You can download the latest MOFED driver from here . This section introduces the example of installation from the tgz archive of MOFED driver version 23.10. The installer software of MOFED driver requires the createrepo and perl packages at least. After that, extract the tgz archive, then kick mlnxofedinstall script. Please don't forget the options to enable GPUDirect Storage features. # dnf install -y perl createrepo # tar zxvf MLNX_OFED_LINUX-23.10-2.1.3.1-rhel9.3-x86_64.tgz # cd MLNX_OFED_LINUX-23.10-2.1.3.1-rhel9.3-x86_64 # ./mlnxofedinstall --with-nvmf --with-nfsrdma --add-kernel-support # dracut -f During the build and installation of MOFED drivers, the installer may require additional packages. In this case, error message shall guide you the missing packages. So, please install them using dnf command. Error: One or more required packages for installing OFED-internal are missing. Please install the missing packages using your Linux distribution Package Management tool. Run: yum install kernel-rpm-macros Failed to build MLNX_OFED_LINUX for 5.14.0-362.8.1.el9_3.x86_64 Once MOFED drivers got installed, it should replace several INBOX drivers like nvme driver. For example, the command below shows the /lib/modules/<KERNEL_VERSION>/extra/mlnx-nvme/host/nvme-rdma.ko that is additionally installed, instead of the INBOX nvme-rdma ( /lib/modules/<KERNEL_VERSION>/kernel/drivers/nvme/host/nvme-rdma.ko.xz ). $ modinfo nvme-rdma filename: /lib/modules/5.14.0-427.18.1.el9_4.x86_64/extra/mlnx-nvme/host/nvme-rdma.ko license: GPL v2 rhelversion: 9.4 srcversion: 16C0049F26768D6EA12771B depends: nvme-core,rdma_cm,ib_core,nvme-fabrics,mlx_compat retpoline: Y name: nvme_rdma vermagic: 5.14.0-427.18.1.el9_4.x86_64 SMP preempt mod_unload modversions parm: register_always:Use memory registration even for contiguous memory regions (bool) Then, shutdown the system and restart, to replace the kernel modules already loaded (like nvme ). Please don't forget to run dracut -f after completion of the mlnxofedinstall script. Tips Linux kernel version up and MOFED driver MODED drivers do not use DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) in RHEL series distributions. Therefore, when the Linux kernel is upgraded, you will need to perform the above steps again to reinstall the MOFED driver that is compatible with the new Linux kernel. The Linux kernel may be updated together when another package is updated, such as when installing the CUDA Toolkit described below, but the same applies in that case. heterodb-swdc Installation PG-Strom and related packages are distributed from HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . You need to add a repository definition of HeteroDB-SWDC for you system to obtain these software. heterodb-swdc package provides the repository definition of HeteroDB-SWDC. Access to the HeteroDB Software Distribution Center using Web browser, download the heterodb-swdc-1.3-1.el9.noarch.rpm on top of the file list, then install this package. (Use heterodb-swdc-1.3-1.el8.noarch.rpm for RHEL8) Once heterodb-swdc package gets installed, yum system configuration is updated to get software from the HeteroDB-SWDC repository. Install the heterodb-swdc package as follows. # dnf install https://heterodb.github.io/swdc/yum/rhel8-noarch/heterodb-swdc-1.2-1.el8.noarch.rpm CUDA Toolkit Installation This section introduces the installation of CUDA Toolkit. If you already installed the latest CUDA Toolkit, you can check whether your installation is identical with the configuration described in this section. NVIDIA offers two approach to install CUDA Toolkit; one is by self-extracting archive (runfile), and the other is by RPM packages. We recommend the RPM installation for PG-Strom setup. You can download the installation package for CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA DEVELOPER ZONE. Choose your OS, architecture, distribution and version, then choose \"rpm(network)\" edition. Once you choose the \"rpm(network)\" option, it shows a few step-by-step shell commands to register the CUDA repository and install the packages. Run the installation according to the guidance. # dnf config-manager --add-repo https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/rhel9/x86_64/cuda-rhel9.repo # dnf clean all # dnf install cuda-toolkit-12-5 Next to the installation of the CUDA Toolkit, two types of commands are introduced to install the nvidia driver. Please use the open source version of nvidia-driver here. Only the open source version supports the GPUDirect Storage feature, and PG-Strom's GPU-Direct SQL utilizes this feature. Tips Use of Volta or former GPUs The open source edition of the nvidia driver does not support Volta generation GPUs or former. Therefore, if you want to use PG-Strom with Volta or Pascal generation GPUs, you need to use CUDA 12.2, whose proprietary driver supports GPUDirect Storage. The CUDA 12.2 package can be obtained here . # dnf module install nvidia-driver:open-dkms # dnf install nvidia-gds Once installation completed successfully, CUDA Toolkit is deployed at /usr/local/cuda . $ ls /usr/local/cuda/ bin/ gds/ nsightee_plugins/ targets/ compute-sanitizer/ include@ nvml/ tools/ CUDA_Toolkit_Release_Notes.txt lib64@ nvvm/ version.json DOCS libnvvp/ README EULA.txt LICENSE share/ extras/ man/ src/ Once installation gets completed, ensure the system recognizes the GPU devices correctly. nvidia-smi command shows GPU information installed on your system, as follows. $ nvidia-smi Mon Jun 3 09:56:41 2024 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 555.42.02 Driver Version: 555.42.02 CUDA Version: 12.5 | |-----------------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M | Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

IMPORT{\u200bprogram}=\"/usr/sbin/mdadm --detail --export $devnode\" Then reboot the system to ensure the new configuration. See NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage Installation and Troubleshooting Guide for the details. PCI Bar1 Memory Configuration GPU-Direct SQL maps GPU device memory to the PCI BAR1 region (physical address space) on the host system, and sends P2P-RDMA requests to NVME devices with that as the destination for the shortest data transfer. To perform P2P-RDMA with sufficient multiplicity, the GPU must have enough PCI BAR1 space to map the device buffer. The size of the PCI BAR1 area is fixed for most GPUs, and PG-Strom recommends products whose size exceeds the GPU device memory size. However, some GPU products allow to change the size of the PCI BAR1 area by switching the operation mode. If your GPU is either of the following, refer to the NVIDIA Display Mode Selector Tool and switch to the mode that maximizes the PCI BAR1 area size. NVIDIA L40S NVIDIA L40 NVIDIA A40 NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada NVIDIA RTX A6000 NVIDIA RTX A5500 NVIDIA RTX A5000 To check the GPU memory size and PCI BAR1 size installed in the system, use the nvidia-smi -q command.

We don't introduce the installation steps from the source because there are many documents for this approach, and there are also various options for the ./configure script. PostgreSQL is also distributed in the packages of Linux distributions, however, it is not the latest one, and often older than the version which supports PG-Strom. For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x distributes PostgreSQL v9.2.x series. This version had been EOL by the PostgreSQL community. PostgreSQL Global Development Group provides yum repository to distribute the latest PostgreSQL and related packages. Like the configuration of EPEL, you can install a small package to set up yum repository, then install PostgreSQL and related software. Here is the list of yum repository definition: http://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php . Repository definitions are per PostgreSQL major version and Linux distribution. You need to choose the one for your Linux distribution, and for PostgreSQL v15 or later. You can install PostgreSQL as following steps: Installation of yum repository definition. Disables the distribution's default PostgreSQL module Installation of PostgreSQL packages. # dnf install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-9-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm # dnf -y module disable postgresql # dnf install -y postgresql16-devel postgresql16-server Note On the Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the package name postgresql conflicts to the default one at the distribution, thus, unable to install the packages from PGDG. So, disable the postgresql module by the distribution, using dnf -y module disable postgresql . PG-Strom Installation RPM Installation PG-Strom and related packages are distributed from HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . If you repository definition has been added, not many tasks are needed. We provide individual RPM packages of PG-Strom for each PostgreSQL major version. pg_strom-PG15 package is built for PostgreSQL v15, and pg_strom-PG16 is also built for PostgreSQL v16. It is a restriction due to binary compatibility of extension modules for PostgreSQL. # dnf install -y pg_strom-PG16 That's all for package installation. Installation from the source For developers, we also introduces the steps to build and install PG-Strom from the source code. Getting the source code Like RPM packages, you can download tarball of the source code from HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . On the other hands, here is a certain time-lags to release the tarball, it may be preferable to checkout the master branch of PG-Strom on GitHub to use the latest development branch. $ git clone https://github.com/heterodb/pg-strom.git Cloning into 'pg-strom'... remote: Counting objects: 13797, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (215/215), done. remote: Total 13797 (delta 208), reused 339 (delta 167), pack-reused 13400 Receiving objects: 100% (13797/13797), 11.81 MiB | 1.76 MiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (10504/10504), done. Building the PG-Strom Configuration to build PG-Strom must match to the target PostgreSQL strictly. For example, if a particular strcut has inconsistent layout by the configuration at build, it may lead problematic bugs; not easy to find out. Thus, not to have inconsistency, PG-Strom does not have own configure script, but references the build configuration of PostgreSQL using pg_config command. If PATH environment variable is set to the pg_config command of the target PostgreSQL, run make and make install . Elsewhere, give PG_CONFIG=... parameter on make command to tell the full path of the pg_config command. $ cd pg-strom/src $ make PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-16/bin/pg_config $ sudo make install PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-16/bin/pg_config Post Installation Setup Creation of database cluster Database cluster is not constructed yet, run initdb command to set up initial database of PostgreSQL. The default path of the database cluster on RPM installation is /var/lib/pgsql/<version number>/data . If you install postgresql-alternatives package, this default path can be referenced by /var/lib/pgdata regardless of the PostgreSQL version. # su - postgres $ /usr/pgsql-16/bin/initdb -D /var/lib/pgdata/ The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user \"postgres\". This user must also own the server process. The database cluster will be initialized with locale \"en_US.UTF-8\". The default database encoding has accordingly been set to \"UTF8\". The default text search configuration will be set to \"english\". Data page checksums are disabled. fixing permissions on existing directory /var/lib/pgdata ... ok creating subdirectories ... ok selecting dynamic shared memory implementation ... posix selecting default max_connections ... 100 selecting default shared_buffers ... 128MB selecting default time zone ... Asia/Tokyo creating configuration files ... ok running bootstrap script ... ok performing post-bootstrap initialization ... ok syncing data to disk ... ok initdb: warning: enabling \"trust\" authentication for local connections You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or --auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb. Success. You can now start the database server using: pg_ctl -D /var/lib/pgdata/ -l logfile start Setup postgresql.conf Next, edit postgresql.conf which is a configuration file of PostgreSQL. The parameters below should be edited at least to work PG-Strom. Investigate other parameters according to usage of the system and expected workloads. shared_preload_libraries PG-Strom module must be loaded on startup of the postmaster process by the shared_preload_libraries . Unable to load it on demand. Therefore, you must add the configuration below. shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/pg_strom' max_worker_processes PG-Strom internally uses several background workers, so the default configuration (= 8) is too small for other usage. So, we recommand to expand the variable for a certain margin. max_worker_processes = 100 shared_buffers Although it depends on the workloads, the initial configuration of shared_buffers is too small for the data size where PG-Strom tries to work, thus storage workloads restricts the entire performance, and may be unable to work GPU efficiently. So, we recommend to expand the variable for a certain margin. shared_buffers = 10GB Please consider to apply SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution to process larger than system's physical RAM size. work_mem Although it depends on the workloads, the initial configuration of work_mem is too small to choose the optimal query execution plan on analytic queries. An typical example is, disk-based merge sort may be chosen instead of the in-memory quick-sorting. So, we recommend to expand the variable for a certain margin. work_mem = 1GB Expand OS resource limits GPU Direct SQL especially tries to open many files simultaneously, so resource limit for number of file descriptors per process should be expanded. Also, we recommend not to limit core file size to generate core dump of PostgreSQL certainly on system crash. If PostgreSQL service is launched by systemd, you can put the configurations of resource limit at /etc/systemd/system/postgresql-XX.service.d/pg_strom.conf . RPM installation setups the configuration below by the default. It comments out configuration to the environment variable CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION . This is a developer option that enables to generate GPU's core dump on any CUDA/GPU level errors, if enabled. See CUDA-GDB:GPU core dump support for more details. [Service] LimitNOFILE=65536 LimitCORE=infinity #Environment=CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION=1 Start PostgreSQL Start PostgreSQL service. If PG-Strom is set up appropriately, it writes out log message which shows PG-Strom recognized GPU devices. The example below recognized two NVIDIA A100 (PCIE; 40GB), and displays the closest GPU identifier foe each NVME-SSD drive. # systemctl start postgresql-16 # journalctl -u postgresql-16 Jun 02 17:28:45 buri.heterodb.com postgres[20242]: 2024-06-02 17:28:45.989 JST [20242] LOG: HeteroDB Extra module loaded [api_version=20240418,cufile=off,nvme_strom=off,githash=3ffc65428c07bb3c9d0e5c75a2973389f91dfcd4] Jun 02 17:28:45 buri.heterodb.com postgres[20242]: 2024-06-02 17:28:45.989 JST [20242] LOG: HeteroDB License: { \"version\" : 2, \"serial_nr\" : \"HDB-TRIAL\", \"issued_at\" : \"2024-06-02\", \"expired_at\" : \"2099-12-31\", \"nr_gpus\" : 1, \"gpus\" : [ { \"uuid\" : \"GPU-13943bfd-5b30-38f5-0473-78979c134606\" } ]} Jun 02 17:28:45 buri.heterodb.com postgres[20242]: 2024-06-02 17:28:45.989 JST [20242] LOG: PG-Strom version 5.12.el9 built for PostgreSQL 16 (githash: ) Jun 02 17:28:48 buri.heterodb.com postgres[20242]: 2024-06-02 17:28:48.114 JST [20242] LOG: PG-Strom binary built for CUDA 12.4 (CUDA runtime 12.5) Jun 02 17:28:48 buri.heterodb.com postgres[20242]: 2024-06-02 17:28:48.114 JST [20242] WARNING: The CUDA version where this PG-Strom module binary was built for (12.4) is newer than the CUDA runtime version on this platform (12.5).

If you want PG-Strom is pre-configured on new database creation, you can create PG-Strom extension on the template1 database, its configuration will be copied to the new database on CREATE DATABASE command. $ psql -U postgres psql (16.3) Type \"help\" for help. postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION pg_strom ; CREATE EXTENSION That's all for the installation. PostGIS Installation PG-Strom supports execution of a part of PostGIS functions on GPU devices. This section introduces the steps to install PostGIS module. Skip it on your demand. PostGIS module can be installed from the yum repository by PostgreSQL Global Development Group, like PostgreSQL itself. The example below shows the command to install PostGIS v3.4 built for PostgreSQL v16. # dnf install postgis34_16 Start PostgreSQL server after the initial setup of database cluster, then run CREATE EXTENSION command from SQL client to define geometry data type and SQL functions for geoanalytics. postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION postgis; CREATE EXTENSION","title":"Install"},{"location":"install/#installation","text":"This chapter introduces the steps to install PG-Strom.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"install/#checklist","text":"Server Hardware It requires generic x86_64 hardware that can run Linux operating system supported by CUDA Toolkit.

GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg are implemented on the CustomScan mechanism. In this example, GpuJoin runs JOIN operation on t0 , t1 and t1 , then GpuPreAgg which receives the result of GpuJoin runs GROUP BY operation by the cat column on GPU device. PG-Strom interacts with the query optimizer during PostgreSQL is building a query execution plan, and it offers alternative query execution plan with estimated cost for PostgreSQL's optimizer, if any of SCAN, JOIN, or GROUP BY are executable on GPU device. This estimated cost is better than other query execution plans that run on CPU, it chooses the alternative execution plan that shall run on GPU device. For GPU execution, it requires operators, functions and data types in use must be supported by PG-Strom. It supports numeric types like int or float , date and time types like date or timestamp , variable length string like text and so on. It also supports arithmetic operations, comparison operators and many built-in operators. See References for the detailed list. CPU+GPU Hybrid Parallel PG-Strom also supports PostgreSQL's CPU parallel execution. In the CPU parallel execution mode, Gather node launches several background worker processes, then it gathers the result of \"partial\" execution by individual background workers. CustomScan execution plan provided by PG-Strom, like GpuJoin or GpuPreAgg, support execution at the background workers. They process their partial task using GPU individually. A CPU core usually needs much more time to set up buffer to supply data for GPU than execution of SQL workloads on GPU, so hybrid usage of CPU and GPU parallel can expect higher performance. On the other hands, each process creates CUDA context that is required to communicate GPU and consumes a certain amount of GPU resources, so higher parallelism on CPU-side is not always better. Look at the query execution plan below. Execution plan tree under the Gather is executable on background worker process. It scans t0 table which has 100million rows using four background worker processes and the coordinator process, in other words, 20million rows are handled per process by GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg, then its results are merged at Gather node. # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 GROUP by cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=955705.47..955720.93 rows=27 width=20) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=955705.47..955707.36 rows=756 width=44) Sort Key: t0.cat -> Gather (cost=955589.95..955669.33 rows=756 width=44) Workers Planned: 4 -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=954589.95..954593.73 rows=189 width=44) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on t0 (cost=27682.82..841218.52 rows=99996736 width=12) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Outer Scan: t0 (cost=0.00..1083384.84 rows=24999184 width=8) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 24999184...99996736) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.39MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (18 rows) Pullup underlying plans (*) This section does not follow the latest version, and need to rewrite according to the latest implementation. PG-Strom can run SCAN, JOIN and GROUP BY workloads on GPU, however, it does not work with best performance if these custom execution plan simply replace the standard operations at PostgreSQL. An example of problematic scenario is that SCAN once writes back its result data set to the host buffer then send the same data into GPU again to execute JOIN. Once again, JOIN results are written back and send to GPU to execute GROUP BY. It causes data ping-pong between CPU and GPU. To avoid such inefficient jobs, PG-Strom has a special mode which pulls up its sub-plan to execute a bunch of jobs in a single GPU kernel invocation. Combination of the operations blow can cause pull-up of sub-plans. SCAN + JOIN SCAN + GROUP BY SCAN + JOIN + GROUP BY The execution plan example below never pulls up the sub-plans. GpuJoin receives the result of GpuScan, then its results are passed to GpuPreAgg to generate the final results. # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 WHERE aid < bid GROUP BY cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=1239991.03..1239995.15 rows=27 width=20) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=1239991.03..1239991.50 rows=189 width=44) Sort Key: t0.cat -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=1239980.10..1239983.88 rows=189 width=44) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) (cost=50776.43..1199522.96 rows=33332245 width=12) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 33332245...33332245) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.39MB) -> Custom Scan (GpuScan) on t0 (cost=12634.49..1187710.85 rows=33332245 width=8) GPU Projection: cat, aid GPU Filter: (aid < bid) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (18 rows) This example causes data ping-pong between GPU and host buffers for each execution stage, so not efficient and less performance. On the other hands, the query execution plan below pulls up sub-plans. # EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 WHERE aid < bid GROUP BY cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=903669.50..903673.62 rows=27 width=20) (actual time=7761.630..7761.644 rows=27 loops=1) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=903669.50..903669.97 rows=189 width=44) (actual time=7761.621..7761.626 rows=27 loops=1) Sort Key: t0.cat Sort Method: quicksort Memory: 28kB -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=903658.57..903662.35 rows=189 width=44) (actual time=7761.531..7761.540 rows=27 loops=1) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on t0 (cost=12483.41..863201.43 rows=33332245 width=12) (never executed) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Outer Scan: t0 (cost=12634.49..1187710.85 rows=33332245 width=8) (actual time=59.623..5557.052 rows=100000000 loops=1) Outer Scan Filter: (aid < bid) Rows Removed by Outer Scan Filter: 50002874 Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (plan nrows: 33332245...33332245, actual nrows: 49997126...49997126) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size plan: 10.39MB, exec: 64.00MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (actual time=0.013..15.303 rows=100000 loops=1) Planning time: 0.506 ms Execution time: 8495.391 ms (21 rows) You may notice that SCAN on the table t0 is embedded into GpuJoin, and GpuScan gets vanished. It means GpuJoin pulls up the underlying GpuScan, then combined GPU kernel function is also responsible for evaluation of the supplied WHERE-clause. In addition, here is a strange output in EXPLAIN ANALYZE result - it displays (never executed) for GpuJoin. It means GpuJoin is never executed during the query execution, and it is right. GpuPreAgg pulls up the underlying GpuJoin, then its combined GPU kernel function runs JOIN and GROUP BY. The pg_strom.pullup_outer_scan parameter controls whether SCAN is pulled up, and the pg_strom.pullup_outer_join parameter also controls whether JOIN is pulled up. Both parameters are configured to on . Usually, no need to disable them, however, you can use the parameters to identify the problems on system troubles. Inner Pinned Buffer of GpuJoin Look at the EXPLAIN output below. When PG-Strom joins tables, it usually reads the largest table ( lineorder in this case; called the OUTER table) asynchronously, while performing join processing and aggregation processing with other tables. Let's proceed. Due to the constraints of the JOIN algorithm, it is necessary to read other tables ( date1 , part , supplier in this case; called the INNER tables) into memory in advance, and also calculate the hash value of the JOIN key. Although these tables are not as large as the OUTER table, preparing an INNER buffer that exceeds several GB is a heavy process. GpuJoin usually reads the INNER table through the PostgreSQL API row-by-row, calculates its hash value, and writes them to the INNER buffer on the host shared memory. The GPU-Service process transfers this INNER buffer onto the GPU device memory, then we can start reading the OUTER table and processing the JOIN with inner tables. If the INNER table is relatively large and contains search conditions that are executable on the GPU, GpuScan may exists under GpuJoin, as in the EXPLAIN output below. In this case, the INNER table is once processed on the GPU by GpuScan, the execution results are returned to the CPU, and then written to the INNER buffer before it is loaded onto the GPU again. It looks like there is quite a bit of wasted data flow. =# explain select sum(lo_revenue), d_year, p_brand1 from lineorder, date1, part, supplier where lo_orderdate = d_datekey and lo_partkey = p_partkey and lo_suppkey = s_suppkey and p_brand1 between 'MFGR#2221' and 'MFGR#2228' and s_region = 'ASIA' group by d_year, p_brand1; QUERY PLAN --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=31007186.70..31023043.21 rows=6482 width=46) Group Key: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1 -> Sort (cost=31007186.70..31011130.57 rows=1577548 width=20) Sort Key: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1 -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on lineorder (cost=275086.19..30844784.03 rows=1577548 width=20) GPU Projection: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1, lineorder.lo_revenue GPU Join Quals [1]: (part.p_partkey = lineorder.lo_partkey) ...

It is possible to shorten the execution start lead time and reduce memory usage. In the above EXPLAIN output, reading of the supplier table will be performed by GpuScan, and according to the statistical information, it is estimated that about 2 million rows will be read from the table. Meanwhile, notice the output of GPU Pinned Buffer: enabled . This is a function that if the estimated size of the INNER table exceeds the configuration value of pg_strom.pinned_inner_buffer_threshold , the processing result of GpuScan is retained in the GPU memory and used as part of the INNER buffer at the next GpuJoin. (If necessary, hash value calculation is also performed on the GPU). Therefore, after the contents of the supplier table are read from storage to the GPU using GPU-Direct SQL, they can be used in the next GPUJoin without being returned to the CPU or loaded to the GPU again. It will be. However, there are some tradeoffs to using Pinned Inner Buffer, so it is disabled by default. When using this feature, you must explicitly set the pg_strom.pinned_inner_buffer_threshold parameter. The CPU side does not completely retain the contents of the INNER buffer when Pinned Inner Buffer is in use. Therefore, CPU fallback processing cannot be performed and an error will be raised. Also, RIGHT/FULL OUTER JOIN, which is implemented using CPU Fallback, cannot coexist with Pinned Inner Buffer for the same reason.

It scans t0 table which has 100million rows using four background worker processes and the coordinator process, in other words, 20million rows are handled per process by GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg, then its results are merged at Gather node. # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 GROUP by cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=955705.47..955720.93 rows=27 width=20) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=955705.47..955707.36 rows=756 width=44) Sort Key: t0.cat -> Gather (cost=955589.95..955669.33 rows=756 width=44) Workers Planned: 4 -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=954589.95..954593.73 rows=189 width=44) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on t0 (cost=27682.82..841218.52 rows=99996736 width=12) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Outer Scan: t0 (cost=0.00..1083384.84 rows=24999184 width=8) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 24999184...99996736) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.39MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (18 rows)","title":"CPU+GPU Hybrid Parallel"},{"location":"operations/#pullup-underlying-plans","text":"(*) This section does not follow the latest version, and need to rewrite according to the latest implementation. PG-Strom can run SCAN, JOIN and GROUP BY workloads on GPU, however, it does not work with best performance if these custom execution plan simply replace the standard operations at PostgreSQL. An example of problematic scenario is that SCAN once writes back its result data set to the host buffer then send the same data into GPU again to execute JOIN. Once again, JOIN results are written back and send to GPU to execute GROUP BY. It causes data ping-pong between CPU and GPU. To avoid such inefficient jobs, PG-Strom has a special mode which pulls up its sub-plan to execute a bunch of jobs in a single GPU kernel invocation. Combination of the operations blow can cause pull-up of sub-plans. SCAN + JOIN SCAN + GROUP BY SCAN + JOIN + GROUP BY The execution plan example below never pulls up the sub-plans. GpuJoin receives the result of GpuScan, then its results are passed to GpuPreAgg to generate the final results. # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 WHERE aid < bid GROUP BY cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=1239991.03..1239995.15 rows=27 width=20) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=1239991.03..1239991.50 rows=189 width=44) Sort Key: t0.cat -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=1239980.10..1239983.88 rows=189 width=44) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) (cost=50776.43..1199522.96 rows=33332245 width=12) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 33332245...33332245) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.39MB) -> Custom Scan (GpuScan) on t0 (cost=12634.49..1187710.85 rows=33332245 width=8) GPU Projection: cat, aid GPU Filter: (aid < bid) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (18 rows) This example causes data ping-pong between GPU and host buffers for each execution stage, so not efficient and less performance.

It means GpuJoin pulls up the underlying GpuScan, then combined GPU kernel function is also responsible for evaluation of the supplied WHERE-clause. In addition, here is a strange output in EXPLAIN ANALYZE result - it displays (never executed) for GpuJoin. It means GpuJoin is never executed during the query execution, and it is right. GpuPreAgg pulls up the underlying GpuJoin, then its combined GPU kernel function runs JOIN and GROUP BY. The pg_strom.pullup_outer_scan parameter controls whether SCAN is pulled up, and the pg_strom.pullup_outer_join parameter also controls whether JOIN is pulled up. Both parameters are configured to on . Usually, no need to disable them, however, you can use the parameters to identify the problems on system troubles.","title":"Pullup underlying plans"},{"location":"operations/#inner-pinned-buffer-of-gpujoin","text":"Look at the EXPLAIN output below. When PG-Strom joins tables, it usually reads the largest table ( lineorder in this case; called the OUTER table) asynchronously, while performing join processing and aggregation processing with other tables. Let's proceed. Due to the constraints of the JOIN algorithm, it is necessary to read other tables ( date1 , part , supplier in this case; called the INNER tables) into memory in advance, and also calculate the hash value of the JOIN key. Although these tables are not as large as the OUTER table, preparing an INNER buffer that exceeds several GB is a heavy process. GpuJoin usually reads the INNER table through the PostgreSQL API row-by-row, calculates its hash value, and writes them to the INNER buffer on the host shared memory. The GPU-Service process transfers this INNER buffer onto the GPU device memory, then we can start reading the OUTER table and processing the JOIN with inner tables. If the INNER table is relatively large and contains search conditions that are executable on the GPU, GpuScan may exists under GpuJoin, as in the EXPLAIN output below. In this case, the INNER table is once processed on the GPU by GpuScan, the execution results are returned to the CPU, and then written to the INNER buffer before it is loaded onto the GPU again. It looks like there is quite a bit of wasted data flow. =# explain select sum(lo_revenue), d_year, p_brand1 from lineorder, date1, part, supplier where lo_orderdate = d_datekey and lo_partkey = p_partkey and lo_suppkey = s_suppkey and p_brand1 between 'MFGR#2221' and 'MFGR#2228' and s_region = 'ASIA' group by d_year, p_brand1; QUERY PLAN --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=31007186.70..31023043.21 rows=6482 width=46) Group Key: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1 -> Sort (cost=31007186.70..31011130.57 rows=1577548 width=20) Sort Key: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1 -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on lineorder (cost=275086.19..30844784.03 rows=1577548 width=20) GPU Projection: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1, lineorder.lo_revenue GPU Join Quals [1]: (part.p_partkey = lineorder.lo_partkey) ...

It is possible to shorten the execution start lead time and reduce memory usage. In the above EXPLAIN output, reading of the supplier table will be performed by GpuScan, and according to the statistical information, it is estimated that about 2 million rows will be read from the table. Meanwhile, notice the output of GPU Pinned Buffer: enabled . This is a function that if the estimated size of the INNER table exceeds the configuration value of pg_strom.pinned_inner_buffer_threshold , the processing result of GpuScan is retained in the GPU memory and used as part of the INNER buffer at the next GpuJoin. (If necessary, hash value calculation is also performed on the GPU). Therefore, after the contents of the supplier table are read from storage to the GPU using GPU-Direct SQL, they can be used in the next GPUJoin without being returned to the CPU or loaded to the GPU again. It will be. However, there are some tradeoffs to using Pinned Inner Buffer, so it is disabled by default. When using this feature, you must explicitly set the pg_strom.pinned_inner_buffer_threshold parameter. The CPU side does not completely retain the contents of the INNER buffer when Pinned Inner Buffer is in use. Therefore, CPU fallback processing cannot be performed and an error will be raised. Also, RIGHT/FULL OUTER JOIN, which is implemented using CPU Fallback, cannot coexist with Pinned Inner Buffer for the same reason.","title":"Inner Pinned Buffer of GpuJoin"},{"location":"operations/#knowledge-base","text":"We publish several articles, just called \"notes\", on the project wiki-site of PG-Strom. https://github.com/heterodb/pg-strom/wiki","title":"Knowledge base"},{"location":"partition/","text":"Partitioning This chapter introduces the way to use PG-Strom and the partitioning feature of PostgreSQL. Note that this chapter is only valid when PG-Strom works on PostgreSQL v11 or later . Also see PostgreSQL Document: Table Partitioning for more details of the partitioning feature of PostgreSQL. Overview PostgreSQL v10 newly support table partitioning. This mechanism splits one logically large table into physically small pieces. It is valuable because it can skip partitioned child tables which is obviously unnecessary to scan from the search qualification, and it can offer broader I/O bandwidth by physically distributed storage and so on. PostgreSQL v10 supports two kinds of them: range-partitioning and list-partitioning. Then, PostgreSQL v11 newly supports hash-partitioning and partition-wise JOINs. The diagram below shows a range-partitioning configuration with date -type key values. A record which has 2018-05-30 as key is distributed to the partition child table tbl_2018 , in the same way, a record which has 2014-03-21 is distributed to the partition child table tbl_2014 , and so on. In case when scan qualifier WHERE ymd > '2016-07-01'::date is added on scan of the partitioned table for example, it is obvious that tbl_2014 and tbl_2015 contains no records to match, therefore, PostgreSQL' optimizer constructs query execution plan which runs on only tbl_2016 , tbl_2017 and tbl_2018 then merges their results by Append node. It shall perform as if records are read from one logical table. When PG-Strom is used with table partitioning of PostgreSQL together, its optimizer may choose GpuScan to scan the individual partition child tables to be scanned, in the result of cost estimation. In this case, Append node merges the results of GpuScan . On the other hands, if query runs JOIN or GROUP BY, which can be accelerated by PG-Strom, next to the scan on partitioned table, it needs consideration from the standpoint of performance optimization. For example, in case when query scans non-partitioned table then runs JOIN with other tables and GROUP BY, under some conditions, it can handle step-step data exchange on GPU device memory. It is an optimal workload for PG-Strom due to minimized data exchange between GPU and CPU. In case when query runs corresponding workload on the partitioned table, it is problematic that Append node is injected into between the child tables scan and JOIN/GROUP BY. Under the query execution plan, the result of GpuScan must be written back to the host system, then Append merges them and send back the data to GPU to run the following GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg. It is never efficient query execution. The example below shows a query execution plan to the query which includes JOIN and GROUP BY towards the partitioned table pt by the key field ymd of date type; per year distribution.

PostGIS provides data type ( Geometry ) for handling geographic data such as points, lines, and polygons, as well as a large number of functions and operators for evaluating geographic data elements, such as distance calculation, inclusion, and intersection determination. In addition, some of the operators can search faster by the R-Tree using GiST(Generalized Search Tree) mechanism included in PostgreSQL. Since the first version was released in 2001, it has been enhanced and maintained by the developer community for over 20 years. These functions and operators provided by PostGIS are very large, over 500 in total. For this reason, PG-Strom has ported only a few relatively frequently used PostGIS functions to the GPU. For example: geometry st_point(float8 lon,float8 lat) returns a point with the given longitude and latitude as a Point of Geometry type. bool st_contains(geometry a,geometry b) determines if the geometry a contains the geometry b or not. bool st_crosses(geometry,geometry) determines if the geometries intersect each other. text st_relate(geometry,geometry) returns the relationship between geometries as a matrix representation of DE-9IM(Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model) . PostGIS Usage You can use GPU-PostGIS without any configurations. PG-Strom will automatically determine if the PostGIS functions used in the query are executable on the GPU when PostGIS is installed from the package or the source code and the geometry data types and PostGIS functions are defined using the CREATE EXTENSION syntax. Please refer to the PostGIS documentaion for installation. For example, the following query uses the GPU-executable PostGIS funtion st_contains() and st_makepoint() to determine if a two-dimensional point read from the table is contained within the range of the geometry type constant 'polygon ((10 10,30 10,30 20,10 20,10 10))' . As you can see from the fact that these functions are listed as part of the \"GPU Filter:\", PG-Strom will automatically detect supported PostGIS functions and attempt to run them on the GPU as much as possible. =# explain select * from dpoints where st_contains('polygon ((10 10,30 10,30 20,10 20,10 10))', st_makepoint(x,y)); QUERY PLAN ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Custom Scan (GpuScan) on dpoints (cost=1397205.10..12627630.76 rows=800 width=28) GPU Filter: st_contains('01030000000100000005000000000000000000244000000000000024400000000000003E4000000000000024400000000000003E4000000000000034400000000000002440000000000000344000000000000024400000000000002440'::geometry, st_makepoint(x, y)) GPU Preference: GPU0 (NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) (3 rows) GiST Index Some of the PostGIS functions that evaluate relationships between geometries, such as st_contains() and st_crosses() , support the GiST index (R-Tree), which enables fast refinement of the search using only the CPU. GpuJoin in PG-Strom sometimes transfers not only the contents of the table but also GiST index (R-Tree) to filter the rows to be joined fast when the join condition between tables can be accelerated. This process is usually executed at a much higher parallelism level than the CPU, so a significant speedup can be expected. On the other hand, GpuScan does not use GiST index to scan a single table. This is because IndexScan filtering by CPU is often faster. The following is an example of a SQL statement to create a GiST index on city boundary data (\"geom\" column of \"giscity\" table). =# CREATE INDEX on giscity USING gist (geom); CREATE INDEX The following is an execution plan of SQL that joins municipal boundary data (\"giscity\" table) and latitude and longitude data (\"dpoints\" table) and outputs the number of latitude and longitude data (points) contained in the area expressed as polygons for each municipality. The optimizer selects GpuJoin, and GpuGiSTJoin to join \"giscity\" table with \"dpoints\" table. The \"IndexFilter:\" line shows that the filtering condition on the GiST index is (g.geom ~ st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) and the index giscity_geom_idx will be used. The execution of PostGIS functions is a relatively \"heavy\" process even for GPU. By using GiST index, we can eliminate combinations that obviously do not match the condition and speed up the search process significantly. =# EXPLAIN SELECT pref, city, count(*) FROM giscity g, dpoints d WHERE pref = 'Tokyo' AND st_contains(g.geom,st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) GROUP BY pref, city; QUERY PLAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=5700646.35..5700759.39 rows=5024 width=29) Group Key: g.n03_001, g.n03_004 -> Sort (cost=5700646.35..5700658.91 rows=5024 width=29) Sort Key: g.n03_004 -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=5700274.71..5700337.51 rows=5024 width=29) Reduction: Local Combined GpuJoin: enabled GPU Preference: GPU0 (NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on dpoints d (cost=638671.58..5668511.23 rows=50821573 width=21) Outer Scan: dpoints d (cost=0.00..141628.18 rows=7999618 width=16) Depth 1: GpuGiSTJoin(nrows 7999618...50821573) HeapSize: 3251.36KB IndexFilter: (g.geom ~ st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) on giscity_geom_idx JoinQuals: st_contains(g.geom, st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) GPU Preference: GPU0 (NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) -> Seq Scan on giscity g (cost=0.00..8929.24 rows=6353 width=1883) Filter: ((pref)::text = 'Tokyo'::text) (17 rows)","title":"PostGIS"},{"location":"postgis/#gpu-postgis","text":"This chapter describes GPU-PostGIS","title":"GPU-PostGIS"},{"location":"postgis/#overview","text":"PostGIS is an extension to PostgreSQL to utilize geographic information.

Note that aggregated function at GPU mapps numeric data type to double precision floating point values. So, if you are sensitive to calculation errors, you can turn off this configuration to suppress the calculation errors by the operations on CPU. pg_strom.enable_brin [type: bool / default: on] Enables/disables BRIN index support on tables scan pg_strom.cpu_fallback [type: enum / default: notice ] Controls whether it actually run CPU fallback operations, if GPU program returned \"CPU ReCheck Error\" notice ... Runs CPU fallback operations with notice message on , true ... Runs CPU fallback operations with no message output off , false ... Disabled CPU fallback operations with an error pg_strom.regression_test_mode [type: bool / default: off] It disables some EXPLAIN command output that depends on software execution platform, like GPU model name. It avoid \"false-positive\" on the regression test, so use usually don't tough this configuration. Optimizer Configuration pg_strom.gpu_setup_cost [type: real / default: 100 * DEFAULT_SEQ_PAGE_COST ] Cost value for initialization of GPU device pg_strom.gpu_tuple_cost [type: real / default: DEFAULT_CPU_TUPLE_COST ] Cost value to send tuples to, or receive tuples from GPU for each. pg_strom.gpu_operator_cost [type: real / default: DEFAULT_CPU_OPERATOR_COST / 16 ] Cost value to process an expression formula on GPU. If larger value than cpu_operator_cost is configured, no chance to choose PG-Strom towards any size of tables pg_strom.enable_partitionwise_gpujoin [type: bool / default: on] Enables/disables whether GpuJoin is pushed down to the partition children. pg_strom.enable_partitionwise_gpupreagg [type: bool / default: on] Enables/disables whether GpuPreAgg is pushed down to the partition children. pg_strom.pinned_inner_buffer_threshold [type: int / \u521d\u671f\u5024: 0 ] If the INNER table of GpuJoin is either GpuScan or GpuJoin, and the estimated size of its processing result is larger than this configured value, the result is retained on the GPU device without being returned to the CPU, and then reused as a part of the INNER buffer of the subsequent GpuJoin. If the configured value is 0 , this function will be disabled. Executor Configuration pg_strom.max_async_tasks [type: int / default: 12 ] Max number of asynchronous taks PG-Strom can submit to the GPU execution queue, and is also the number of GPU Service worker threads. GPUDirect SQL Configuration pg_strom.gpudirect_driver [type: text ] It shows the driver software name of GPUDirect SQL (read-only). Either cufile , nvme-strom or vfs pg_strom.gpudirect_enabled [type: bool / default: on ] Enables/disables GPUDirect SQL feature. pg_strom.gpu_direct_seq_page_cost [type: real / default: DEFAULT_SEQ_PAGE_COST / 4 ] The cost of scanning a table using GPU-Direct SQL, instead of the seq_page_cost , when the optimizer calculates the cost of an execution plan. pg_strom.gpudirect_threshold [type: int / default: auto] Controls the table-size threshold to invoke GPUDirect SQL feature. The default is auto configuration; a threshold calculated by the system physical memory size and shared_buffers configuration. pg_strom.manual_optimal_gpus [type: text / default: none] It manually configures the closest GPU for the target storage volumn, like NVME device or NFS volume. Its format string is: {<nvmeX>|/path/to/tablespace}=gpuX[:gpuX...] . It describes relationship between the closest GPU and NVME device or tablespace directory path. It accepts multiple configurations separated by comma character. Example: pg_strom.manual_optimal_gpus = 'nvme1=gpu0,nvme2=gpu1,/mnt/nfsroot=gpu0' <gpuX> means a GPU with device identifier X. <nvmeX> means a local NVME-SSD or a remote NVME-oF device. /path/to/tablespace means full-path of the tablespace directory. Automatic configuration is often sufficient for local NVME-SSD drives, however, you should manually configure the closest GPU for NVME-oF or NFS-over-RDMA volumes. Arrow_Fdw Configuration arrow_fdw.enabled [type: bool / default: on ] By adjustment of estimated cost value, it turns on/off Arrow_Fdw. Note that only Foreign Scan (Arrow_Fdw) can scan on Arrow files, if GpuScan is not capable to run on. arrow_fdw.stats_hint_enabled [type: bool / default: on ] When Arrow file has min/max statistics, this parameter controls whether unnecessary record-batches shall be skipped, or not. arrow_fdw.metadata_cache_size [type: int / default: 512MB ] Size of shared memory to cache metadata of Arrow files. Once consumption of the shared memory exceeds this value, the older metadata shall be released based on LRU. GPU Cache configuration pg_strom.enable_gpucache [type: bool / default: on ] Controls whether search/analytic query tries to use GPU Cache. Note that GPU Cache trigger functions continue to update the REDO Log buffer, even if this parameter is turned off. pg_strom.gpucache_auto_preload [type: text / default: null ] It specifies the table names to be loaded onto GPU Cache just after PostgreSQL startup. Its format is DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME , and separated by comma if multiple tables are preloaded. Initial-loading of GPU Cache usually takes a lot of time. So, preloading enables to avoid delay of response time of search/analytic queries on the first time. If this parameter is '*', PG-Strom tries to load all the configured tables onto GPU Cache sequentially. GPU Device Configuration pg_strom.gpu_mempool_segment_sz [type: int / default: 1GB ] The segment size when GPU Service allocates GPU device memory for the memory pool. GPU device memory allocation is a relatively heavy process, so it is recommended to use memory pools to reuse memory. pg_strom.gpu_mempool_max_ratio [type: real / default: 50% ] It specifies the percentage of device memory that can be used for the GPU device memory memory pool. It works to suppress excessive GPU device memory consumption by the memory pool and ensure sufficient working memory. pg_strom.gpu_mempool_min_ratio [type: real / default: 5% ] It specify the percentage of GPU device memory that is preserved as the memory pool segment, and remained even after memory usage. By maintaining a minimum memory pool, the next query can be executed quickly. pg_strom.gpu_mempool_release_delay [type: int / default: 5000 ] GPU Service does not release a segment of a memory pool immediately, even if it becomes empty. When the time specified by this parameter (in milliseconds) has elapsed since the segment was last used, it is released and returned to the system. By inserting a certain delay, you can reduce the frequency of GPU device memory allocation/release. pg_strom.gpuserv_debug_output [type: bool / default: false ] Enable/disable GPU Service debug message output.

Usually, users don't need to invoke this function. void pgstrom.arrow_fdw_import_file(text, text, text = null) This function tries to import Apache Arrow file, and defines a new foreign table. Its first argument is name of the new foreign table, the second argument is path of the Apache Arrow file, and the optional third argument is the schema name. This function is similar to IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA statement, but allows to import Apache Arrow files that have wider fields than the limitation of number of columns in PostgreSQL ( MaxTupleAttributeNumber = 1664). So, we recommend to use IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA statement for most cases.

Prerequisites PostgreSQL v9.6, v10 CUDA Toolkit 9.1 Linux distributions supported by CUDA Toolkit Intel x86 64bit architecture (x86_64) NVIDIA GPU CC 6.0 or later (Pascal or Volta) New Features Entire re-design and stabilization of the internal infrastructure to manage GPU device. PostgreSQL backend process simultaneously uses only one GPU at most. In case of multi-GPUs installation, it assumes combination use with CPU parallel execution of PostgreSQL. Usually, it is not a matter because throughput of CPU to provide data to GPU is much narrower than capability of GPU processors. We prioritized simpleness of the software architecture. We began to utilize the demand paging feature of GPU device memory supported at the GPU models since Pascal generation. In most of SQL workloads, we cannot know exact size of the required result buffer prior to its execution, therefore, we had allocated more buffer than estimated buffer length, and retried piece of the workloads if estimated buffer size is not sufficient actually. This design restricts available resources of GPU which can be potentially used for other concurrent processes, and complicated error-retry logic was a nightmare for software quality. The demand paging feature allows to eliminate and simplify these stuffs. We stop to use CUDA asynchronous interface. Use of the demand paging feature on GPU device memory makes asynchronous APIs for DMA (like cuMemCpyHtoD ) perform synchronously, then it reduces concurrency and usage ratio of GPU kernels. Instead of the CUDA asynchronous APIs, PG-Strom manages its own worker threads which call synchronous APIs for each. As a by-product, we also could eliminate asynchronous callbacks ( cuStreamAddCallback ), it allows to use MPS daemon which has a restriction at this API. CPU+GPU Hybrid Parallel Execution CPU parallel execution at PostgreSQL v9.6 is newly supported. CustomScan logic of GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg provided by PG-Strom are executable on multiple background worker processes of PostgreSQL in parallel. Limitation: PG-Strom's own statistics displayed at EXPLAIN ANALYZE if CPU parallel execution. Because PostgreSQL v9.6 does not provide ShutdownCustomScan callback of the CustomScan interface, coordinator process has no way to reclaim information of worker processes prior to the release of DSM (Dynamic Shared Memory) segment. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution By cooperation with the nvme_strom Linux kernel module, it enables to load PostgreSQL's data blocks on NVMe-SSD to GPU device memory directly, bypassing the CPU and host buffer. This feature enables to apply PG-Strom on the area which have to process large data set more than system RAM size. It allows to pull out pretty high throughput close to the hardware limitation because its data stream skips block-device or filesystem layer. Then, GPU runs SQL workloads that usually reduce the amount of data to be processed by CPU. The chemical reaction of these characteristics enables to redefine GPU's role as accelerator of I/O workloads also, not only computing intensive workloads. In-memory Columnar Cache For middle size data-set loadable onto the system RAM, it allows to cache data-blocks in column format which is more suitable for GPU computing. If cached data-blocks are found during table scan, PG-Strom prefers to reference the columnar cache more than shared buffer of PostgreSQL. In-memory columnar cache can be built synchronously, or asynchronously by the background workers. You may remember very early revision of PG-Strom had similar feature. In case when a cached tuple gets updated, the latest in-memory columnar cache which we newly implemented in v2.0 invalidates the cache block which includes the updated tuples. It never updates the columnar cache according to the updates of row-store, so performance degradation is quite limited. GPU Memory Store (gstore_fdw) It enables to write to / read from preserved GPU device memory region by SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE in SQL-level, using foreign table interface. In v2.0, only pgstrom internal data format is supported. It saves written data using PG-Strom's buffer format of KDS_FORMAT_COLUMN . It can compress variable length data using LZ algorithm. In v2.0, GPU memory store can be used as data source of PL/CUDA user defined function. Redesign and performance improvement of GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg Stop using Dynamic Parallelism which we internally used in GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg, and revised entire logic of these operations. Old design had a problem of less GPU usage ratio because a GPU kernel which launches GPU sub-kernel and just waits for its completion occupied GPU's execution slot. A coproduct of this redesign is suspend/resume of GpuJoin. In principle, JOIN operation of SQL may generate larger number of rows than number of input rows, but preliminary not predictive. The new design allows to suspend GPU kernel once buffer available space gets lacked, then resume with new result buffer. It simplifies size estimation logic of the result buffer, and eliminates GPU kernel retry by lack of buffer on run-time. GpuPreAgg+GpuJoin+GpuScan combined GPU kernel In case when GPU executable SCAN, JOIN and GROUP BY are serially cascaded, a single GPU kernel invocation runs a series of tasks equivalent to the GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg. This is an approach to minimize data exchange between CPU and GPU. For example, result buffer of GpuJoin is used as input buffer of GpuPreAgg. This feature is especially valuable if combined with SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. PL/CUDA Enhancement #plcuda_include is enhanced to specify SQL function which returns text type. It can change the code block to inject according to the argument, so it also allows to generate multiple GPU kernel variations, not only inclusion of externally defined functions. If PL/CUDA takes reggstore type argument, GPU kernel function receives pointer of the GPU memory store. Note that it does not pass the OID value. Other Enhancement lo_import_gpu and lo_export_gpu functions allows to import contents of the GPU device memory acquired by external applications directly, or export contents of the largeobject to the GPU device memory.

All the software packages are available at HeteroDB SWDC(Software Distribution Center) and downloadable. Document PG-Strom documentation was entirely rewritten using markdown and mkdocs. It makes documentation maintenance easier than the previous HTML based approach, so expects timely updates according to the development of new features. Test Regression test for PG-Strom was built on top of the regression test framework of PostgreSQL. Dropped features PostgreSQL v9.5 Support PostgreSQL v9.6 had big changes in both of the optimizer and executor to support CPU parallel query execution. The biggest change for extension modules that interact them is an enhancement of the interface called \"upper planner path-ification\". It allows to choose an optimal execution-plan from the multiple candidates based on the estimated cost, even if it is aggregation or sorting. It is fundamentally different from the older way where we rewrote query execution plan to inject GpuPreAgg using the hooks. It allows to inject GpuPreAgg node in more reasonable and reliable way, and we could drop complicated (and buggy) logic to rewrite query execution plan once constructed. CustomScan interface is also enhanced to support CPU parallel execution. Due to the reason, we dropped PostgreSQL v9.5 support to follow these new enhancement. GpuSort feature We dropped GpuSort because we have little advantages in the performance. Sorting is one of the GPU suitable workloads. However, in case when we try to sort data blocks larger than GPU device memory, we have to split the data blocks into multiple chunks, then partially sort them and merge them by CPU to generate final results. Larger chunk size is better to reduce the load to merge multiple chunks by CPU, on the other hands, larger chunk size takes larger lead time to launch GPU kernel to sort. It means here is a trade-off; which disallows asynchronous processing by PG-Strom to make data transfer latency invisible.

PostgreSQL backend process simultaneously uses only one GPU at most. In case of multi-GPUs installation, it assumes combination use with CPU parallel execution of PostgreSQL. Usually, it is not a matter because throughput of CPU to provide data to GPU is much narrower than capability of GPU processors. We prioritized simpleness of the software architecture. We began to utilize the demand paging feature of GPU device memory supported at the GPU models since Pascal generation. In most of SQL workloads, we cannot know exact size of the required result buffer prior to its execution, therefore, we had allocated more buffer than estimated buffer length, and retried piece of the workloads if estimated buffer size is not sufficient actually. This design restricts available resources of GPU which can be potentially used for other concurrent processes, and complicated error-retry logic was a nightmare for software quality. The demand paging feature allows to eliminate and simplify these stuffs. We stop to use CUDA asynchronous interface. Use of the demand paging feature on GPU device memory makes asynchronous APIs for DMA (like cuMemCpyHtoD ) perform synchronously, then it reduces concurrency and usage ratio of GPU kernels. Instead of the CUDA asynchronous APIs, PG-Strom manages its own worker threads which call synchronous APIs for each. As a by-product, we also could eliminate asynchronous callbacks ( cuStreamAddCallback ), it allows to use MPS daemon which has a restriction at this API. CPU+GPU Hybrid Parallel Execution CPU parallel execution at PostgreSQL v9.6 is newly supported. CustomScan logic of GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg provided by PG-Strom are executable on multiple background worker processes of PostgreSQL in parallel. Limitation: PG-Strom's own statistics displayed at EXPLAIN ANALYZE if CPU parallel execution. Because PostgreSQL v9.6 does not provide ShutdownCustomScan callback of the CustomScan interface, coordinator process has no way to reclaim information of worker processes prior to the release of DSM (Dynamic Shared Memory) segment. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution By cooperation with the nvme_strom Linux kernel module, it enables to load PostgreSQL's data blocks on NVMe-SSD to GPU device memory directly, bypassing the CPU and host buffer. This feature enables to apply PG-Strom on the area which have to process large data set more than system RAM size. It allows to pull out pretty high throughput close to the hardware limitation because its data stream skips block-device or filesystem layer. Then, GPU runs SQL workloads that usually reduce the amount of data to be processed by CPU. The chemical reaction of these characteristics enables to redefine GPU's role as accelerator of I/O workloads also, not only computing intensive workloads. In-memory Columnar Cache For middle size data-set loadable onto the system RAM, it allows to cache data-blocks in column format which is more suitable for GPU computing. If cached data-blocks are found during table scan, PG-Strom prefers to reference the columnar cache more than shared buffer of PostgreSQL. In-memory columnar cache can be built synchronously, or asynchronously by the background workers. You may remember very early revision of PG-Strom had similar feature. In case when a cached tuple gets updated, the latest in-memory columnar cache which we newly implemented in v2.0 invalidates the cache block which includes the updated tuples. It never updates the columnar cache according to the updates of row-store, so performance degradation is quite limited. GPU Memory Store (gstore_fdw) It enables to write to / read from preserved GPU device memory region by SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE in SQL-level, using foreign table interface. In v2.0, only pgstrom internal data format is supported. It saves written data using PG-Strom's buffer format of KDS_FORMAT_COLUMN . It can compress variable length data using LZ algorithm. In v2.0, GPU memory store can be used as data source of PL/CUDA user defined function.

Several PostGIS functions are executable on GPUs. GpuJoin using GiST index is now supported. GPU Cache mechanism is newly implemented. User-defined GPU data types/functions/operators are experimentally supported. Software license was switched from GPLv2 to PostgreSQL license. Prerequisites PostgreSQL v11, v12, v13 CUDA Toolkit 11.2 or later Linux distributions supported by CUDA Toolkit Intel x86 64bit architecture (x86_64) NVIDIA GPU CC 6.0 or later (Pascal or newer) NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage GPUDirect Storage , has been developed by NVIDIA, is now supported as a driver for GPU Direct SQL , in addition to the existing nvme_strom kernel module. Both of drivers have almost equivalent functionalities and performance, but supports of GPUDirect Storage enables P2P direct read from NVME-oF (NVME over Fabrics) devices, SDS (Software Defined Storage) devices and shared filesystem built on these devices. Therefore, it offers larger and more flexible storage configuration. We can use GPUDirect SQL to scan PostgreSQL's heap table and Apache Arrow files. It can expect significant performance improvement for the workloads where table scans are the major bottleneck, in either driver cases. The performance measurement below is by SSBM (Star Schema Benchmark) using 1xGPU and 4xNVME-SSDs under the GPUDirect Storage driver. It shows number of rows processed per unit time is significantly improved regardless of the storage system; either PostgreSQL heap or Apache Arrow. In comparison of the read throughput from NVME-SSD drives during the query execution, it shows the table scan by GPUDirect Storage pulls out almost optimal performance close to the hardware limitation, much faster than the scan by filesystem (PostgreSQL Heap Storage). GPU-PostGIS and GiST-index We have implemented GPU versions of several PostGIS functions. When these PostGIS functions are used in qualifier clauses (like, WHERE-clause), PG-Strom will automatically generate a GPU program to execute it on the GPU. The main target of GPU version of PostGIS is the workload to check the real-time location data of mobile devices, like smartphones or vehicles, against the area definition data like boundary of municipality or school districts. For example, when you want to deliver an advertisement to smartphonws in a particular area, or when you want to deliver traffic jam information to cara in a particular area, it is effective in the process of searching for the corresponding device using the position as a key. In the following example, it creates 16 million random points data in a rectangular area that includes the Tokyo region, then count up number of the points contained in the cities in Tokyo for each. The vanilla PostGIS and GiST index took more than 160sec, on the other hand, GPU-version of PostGIS and GiST index responded in 0.830 sec. GPU Cache GPU Cache mechanism can store a copy of the target table in a pre-allocated area on the GPU device memory. It was designed for efficient execution of analytical/search queries on frequently updated data with relatively small data size (~10GB). The GPU can process SQL workloads by referring to GPU Cache instead of loading data from tables when executing analytical/search queries. This is typically a workload that keeps real-time data from millions of devices on the GPU and frequently updates timestamps and location information. When the table with GPU cache is updated, the update history is stored in the on-memory redo log buffer, then applied to the GPU cache at a regular intervals or before executing the analysis / search workload. By this mechanism, it achieved both of frequent updates and consistency of GPU cache. User-defined GPU datatype/functions A new API is provided to add user-defined GPU data types/functions. This allows users to define and implement their own niche data types and SQL functions to process them, without modifying PG-Strom itself. Notice This API is still under the experimental state, so its specifications may be changed without notifications. Also note that we assume the users of this API well understand PG-Strom internal, so no documentations are provided right now. PostgreSQL License Adoption PG-Strom v3.0 or later adopt the PostgreSQL License.

For example, when you want to deliver an advertisement to smartphonws in a particular area, or when you want to deliver traffic jam information to cara in a particular area, it is effective in the process of searching for the corresponding device using the position as a key. In the following example, it creates 16 million random points data in a rectangular area that includes the Tokyo region, then count up number of the points contained in the cities in Tokyo for each.

Process model was revised to multi-threaded background worker (PG-Strom GPU Service) from multi-process model. It reduced GPU resource consumption and overhead of task-switching. GPU device code dynamically generated using CUDA C++ was replaced by the pseudo kernel code. It eliminates just-in-time compilation using NVRTC, and improved the first response time. This is also a groundwork for the future support of CSD(Computational Storage Drive) and DPU(Data Processing Unit). GPU-Cache is now deployed on CUDA managed memory that allows overcommit of GPU device memory. Data layout of PostgreSQL data types were revised to adjust Coalesced Memory Access. GpuPreAgg replaced entire GROUP BY implementation, then improved whole performance. GpuJoin extract tuples only once regardless of the depth of Join. Arrow_Fdw and Pg2Arrow supports min/max statistics of arrow files. Two arrow tools were added: Pca2Arrow captures network packets, and arrow2csv dumps arrow files in CSV format. Prerequisites PostgreSQL v15.x, v16.x CUDA Toolkit 12.2 or later Linux distributions supported by CUDA Toolkit Intel x86 64bit architecture (x86_64) NVIDIA GPU CC 6.0 or later (Pascal at least; Volta or newer is recommended) New Process Model In v5.0, the multi-threaded background worker process (PG-Strom GPU Service) coordinates GPU resources and task executions, and individual PostgreSQL backend processes send requests to and receive results from the GPU service over IPC. Before the v3.x series, each PostgreSQL backend controls GPU devices individually. This design helps software debugging by easy identification of the problematic code when software quality of CUDA and PG-Strom were not sufficient, however, it extremely consumed GPU resources according to increase of database sessions, and was not recommended software architecture from the standpoint of task-switching. This design change makes PG-Strom v5.0 more stable towards increase of concurrent database sessions, and improves heavy GPU task's performance. Pseudo device code PG-Strom v5.0 now generates its own \"pseudo-code\" from the supplied SQL, and the GPU device code works as an interpreter to execute this \"pseudo-code\". Unlike v3.x series, it does not generate CUDA C++ native code no longer. At first glance, this may appear to be a factor in performance degradation. However, dynamic code generation was originally targeted for only a small part of the code that changes with each query, such as the WHERE clause; most implementations were statically built, and runtime compilation was handled by NVRTC. (approximately 150ms) can now be omitted, contributing to improved response time. The \"pseudo-code\" is a set of low-level commands, can be displayed in EXPLAIN VERBOSE. For example, the query below contains the expression lo_quantity > 10 in the WHERE clause. This operation is defined as Scan Quals OpCode to call the numeric_gt function which compares the magnitude relationship between the lo_quantity column and the constant 10 . postgres=# explain verbose select count(*), sum(lo_quantity), lo_shipmode from lineorder where lo_quantity > 10 group by lo_shipmode; QUERY PLAN ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HashAggregate (cost=3242387.01..3242387.10 rows=7 width=51) Output: pgstrom.fcount((pgstrom.nrows())), pgstrom.sum_fp_num((pgstrom.psum((lo_quantity)::double precision))), lo_shipmode Group Key: lineorder.lo_shipmode -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) on public.lineorder (cost=3242386.89..3242386.96 rows=7 width=51) Output: (pgstrom.nrows()), (pgstrom.psum((lo_quantity)::double precision)), lo_shipmode GPU Projection: pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.psum((lo_quantity)::double precision), lo_shipmode GPU Scan Quals: (lo_quantity > '10'::numeric) [rows: 600128800 -> 479262800] GPU-Direct SQL: enabled (GPU-0) KVars-Slot: <slot=0, type='numeric', expr='lo_quantity'>, <slot=1, type='bpchar', expr='lo_shipmode'>, <slot=2, type='bpchar', expr='lo_shipmode'>, <slot=3, type='float8', expr='lo_quantity'> KVecs-Buffer: nbytes: 83968, ndims: 2, items=[kvec0=<0x0000-dfff, type='numeric', expr='lo_quantity'>, kvec1=<0xe000-147ff, type='bpchar', expr='lo_shipmode'>] LoadVars OpCode: {Packed items[0]={LoadVars(depth=0): kvars=[<slot=0, type='numeric' resno=9(lo_quantity)>, <slot=1, type='bpchar' resno=17(lo_shipmode)>]}} MoveVars OpCode: {Packed items[0]={MoveVars(depth=0): items=[<slot=0, offset=0x0000-dfff, type='numeric', expr='lo_quantity'>, <slot=1, offset=0xe000-147ff, type='bpchar', expr='lo_shipmode'>]}}} Scan Quals OpCode: {Func(bool)::numeric_gt args=[{Var(numeric): slot=0, expr='lo_quantity'}, {Const(numeric): value='10'}]} Group-By KeyHash OpCode: {HashValue arg={SaveExpr: <slot=1, type='bpchar'> arg={Var(bpchar): kvec=0xe000-14800, expr='lo_shipmode'}}} Group-By KeyLoad OpCode: {LoadVars(depth=-2): kvars=[<slot=2, type='bpchar' resno=3(lo_shipmode)>]} Group-By KeyComp OpCode: {Func(bool)::bpchareq args=[{Var(bpchar): slot=1, expr='lo_shipmode'}, {Var(bpchar): slot=2, expr='lo_shipmode'}]} Partial Aggregation OpCode: {AggFuncs <nrows[*], psum::fp[slot=3, expr='lo_quantity'], vref[slot=1, expr='lo_shipmode']> args=[{SaveExpr: <slot=3, type='float8'> arg={Func(float8)::float8 arg={Var(numeric): kvec=0x0000-e000, expr='lo_quantity'}}}, {SaveExpr: <slot=1, type='bpchar'> arg={Var(bpchar): kvec=0xe000-14800, expr='lo_shipmode'}}]} Partial Function BufSz: 24 (18 rows) Although not currently implemented, this pseudo-code is also designed to offload SQL processing to a CSD (Computational Storage Drive) or DPU (Data Processing Unit) in the future. Improvement of data layout GPU has a wider memory bandwidth than CPU, but in order to take advantage of this performance, it is necessary to satisfy the condition of coalesced memory access, which accesses nearby memory areas at the same time. In v5.0, the layout of PostgreSQL data types in GPU device code has been improved to make them more suitable for Coalesced Memory Access. If we would use the PostgreSQL data type as is, fields that are referenced at certain times will be placed in discrete positions, making it impossible to effectively utilize the read bandwidth from DRAM. By arranging multiple of these for each field, adjacent cores can read data from adjacent areas, making it easier to satisfy the conditions of Coalesced Memory Access. This improvement is aimed at bringing out sufficient execution performance not only for high-end GPU products with extremely high performance memory bandwidth, but also for mid-end GPUs. Arrow_Fdw supports min/max statistics Pg2Arrow can now generate Apache Arrow files with min/max statistics. Its new option --stat=COLUMN_NAME records the maximum/minimum value of the specified column for each RecordBatch and embeds it in the footer using Apache Arrow's Custom-Metadata mechanism. When reading an Apache Arrow file using Arrow_Fdw, perform like a range index scan using the above min/max statistics. For example, if the WHERE-clause for the Arrow_Fdw foreign table is as follows: WHERE ymd BETERRN '2020-01-01'::date AND '2021-12-31'::date Arrow_Fdw will skip the record-batch where the maximum value of the ymd field is less than '2020-01-01'::date , or the record-batch where the minimum value of ymd field is greater than '2021-12-31 ::date`, because it is obvious that it does not match the search conditions. As a result, performance equivalent to narrowing down using a range index can be obtained for datasets with patterns in which records with similar values \u200b\u200bare clustered nearby, such as log data timestamps.

Then, in PG-Strom v5.1, we fundamentally revised the internal design, re-implemented it, and incorporated it as an official feature again. If the lineorder table below is partitioned and the date1 table is a non-partitioned table, previously all the data read from the partitioned tables under lineorder must be joined with date1 table after the consolidation of all the partition leafs by the Append node.

In some cases, it is also possible to complete the GROUP-BY processing and then return much smaller results to CPU. For example, in the example below, 70 million rows extracted from a total of 600 million rows in the partitioned child tables. By performing a JOIN with the non-partitioned table date1 and then aggregation function SUM() pushed-down to the partitioned child tables, the CPU only needs to process 8 rows.

Although this is simple, the GPU binary module often raised a runtime error depending on the combination of CUDA Toolkit and NVIDIA driver versions in the PG-Strom (PostgreSQL) execution environment. Typically, this is when the execution environment has an older version of the CUDA Toolkit or NVIDIA driver installed than the environment in which the RPM package was built. PG-Strom v5.1 has been changed to check the GPU source code and CUDA Toolkit version at startup, and build a GPU binary module if there are any difference. With this fix, PG-Strom can now utilize GPU devices and GPU binary modules for CUDA Toolkit in the execution environment. pg2arrow parallel execution pg2arrow now supports the new -n|--num-workers and -k|--parallel-keys options. -n N_WORKERS option launches the specified number of threads to connect to PostgreSQL for each, execute queries in parallel, and write the results to the Apache Arrow file. Queries can contain the special token $(N_WORKERS) and $(WORKER_ID) , which will be replaced by the number of workers and worker-specific ID values, respectively, when querying PostgreSQL. It is user's responsibility to ensure the tuples read by each worker thread do not overlap or are missing. Another -k|--parallel-key option starts a worker thread for each comma-separated key value given by the argument, and replaces $(PARALLEL_KEY) with the key in the query. The worker thread runs this query for each, then write the result as an Apache Arrow file. For example, if the lineorder table is partitioned and there are child tables lineorder__sun , lineorder__mon , ... lineorder__sat , each worker thread scans each child table of the partition according to the keys given by the -k sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat option. This parallel key is replaced by the $(PARALLEL_KEY) in the query given by -c 'SELECT * FROM lineorder__$(PARALLEL_KEY)' option. It launches 7 worker threads which shall scan the partitioned child table for each. $ pg2arrow -d ssbm -c 'SELECT * FROM lineorder__$(PARALLEL_KEY)' -o /path/to/f_lineorder.arrow -k=sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat --progress worker:1 SQL=[SELECT * FROM lineorder__sun] worker:3 SQL=[SELECT * FROM lineorder__tue] worker:2 SQL=[SELECT * FROM lineorder__mon] worker:4 SQL=[SELECT * FROM lineorder__wed] worker:5 SQL=[SELECT * FROM lineorder__thu] : :","title":"PG-Strom v5.1"},{"location":"release_v5.1/#pg-strom-v51-release","text":"PG-Strom Development Team (17-Apr-2024)","title":"PG-Strom v5.1 Release"},{"location":"release_v5.1/#overview","text":"Major changes in PG-Strom v5.1 are as follows: Added support for partition-wise GPU-Join/PreAgg.

In some cases, it is also possible to complete the GROUP-BY processing and then return much smaller results to CPU. For example, in the example below, 70 million rows extracted from a total of 600 million rows in the partitioned child tables. By performing a JOIN with the non-partitioned table date1 and then aggregation function SUM() pushed-down to the partitioned child tables, the CPU only needs to process 8 rows. Although there is a disadvantage that reading on the INNER side occurs multiple times (* This will be fixed in a future version), this type of rewriting will significantly reduce the amount of data that must be processed by the CPU, contributing to improved processing speed.

Processor will run idle if data stream would not be delivered. GPUDirect SQL Execution directly connects NVMe-SSD which enables high-speed I/O processing by direct attach to the PCIe bus and GPU device that is also attached on the same PCIe bus, and runs SQL workloads very high speed by supplying data stream close to the wired speed of the hardware. Usually, PostgreSQL data blocks on the storage shall be once loaded to CPU/RAM through the PCIe bus, then, PostgreSQL runs WHERE-clause for filtering or JOIN/GROUP BY according to the query execution plan. Due to the characteristics of analytic workloads, the amount of result data set is much smaller than the source data set. For example, it is not rare case to read billions rows but output just hundreds rows after the aggregation operations with GROUP BY. In the other words, we consume bandwidth of the PCIe bus to move junk data, however, we cannot determine whether rows are necessary or not prior to the evaluation by SQL workloads on CPU. So, it is not avoidable restriction in usual implementation. GPU Direct SQL Execution changes the flow to read blocks from the storage sequentially. It directly loads data blocks to GPU using peer-to-peer DMA over PCIe bus, then runs SQL workloads on GPU device to reduce number of rows to be processed by CPU. In other words, it utilizes GPU as a pre-processor of SQL which locates in the middle of the storage and CPU/RAM for reduction of CPU's load, then tries to accelerate I/O processing in the results. This feature internally uses the NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage module ( nvidia-fs ) to coordinate P2P data transfer from NVME storage to GPU device memory. So, this feature requires this Linux kernel module, in addition to PG-Strom as an extension of PostgreSQL. Also note that this feature supports only NVME-SSD or NVME-oF remove devices. It does not support legacy storages like SAS or SATA-SSD. We have tested several NVMD-SSD models. You can refer 002: HW Validation List for your information. System Setup Driver Installation The previous version of PG-Strom required its original Linux kernel module developed by HeteroDB for GPU-Direct SQL support, however, the version 3.0 revised the software design to use GPUDirect Storage provided by NVIDIA, as a part of CUDA Toolkit. The Linux kernel module for GPUDirect Storage ( nvidia-fs ) is integrated into the CUDA Toolkit installation process and requires no additional configuration if you have set up your system as described in the Installation chapter of this manual. You can check whether the required Linux kernel drivers are installed using the modinfo command or lsmod command. $ modinfo nvidia-fs filename: /lib/modules/5.14.0-427.18.1.el9_4.x86_64/extra/nvidia-fs.ko.xz description: NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage license: GPL v2 version: 2.20.5 rhelversion: 9.4 srcversion: 096A726CAEC0A059E24049E depends: retpoline: Y name: nvidia_fs vermagic: 5.14.0-427.18.1.el9_4.x86_64 SMP preempt mod_unload modversions sig_id: PKCS#7 signer: DKMS module signing key sig_key: 18:B4:AE:27:B8:7D:74:4F:C2:27:68:2A:EB:E0:6A:F0:84:B2:94:EE sig_hashalgo: sha512 : : $ lsmod | grep nvidia nvidia_fs 323584 32 nvidia_uvm 6877184 4 nvidia 8822784 43 nvidia_uvm,nvidia_fs drm 741376 2 drm_kms_helper,nvidia Designing Tablespace GPU Direct SQL Execution shall be invoked in the following case. The target table to be scanned locates on the partition being consist of NVMe-SSD. /dev/nvmeXXXX block device, or md-raid0 volume which consists of NVMe-SSDs only. The target table size is larger than pg_strom.gpudirect_threshold . You can adjust this configuration. Its default is physical RAM size of the system plus 1/3 of shared_buffers configuration. Note Striped read from multiple NVMe-SSD using md-raid0 requires the enterprise subscription provided by HeteroDB,Inc. In order to deploy the tables on the partition consists of NVMe-SSD, you can use the tablespace function of PostgreSQL to specify particular tables or databases to place them on NVMe-SSD volume, in addition to construction of the entire database cluster on the NVMe-SSD volume. For example, you can create a new tablespace below, if NVMe-SSD is mounted at /opt/nvme . CREATE TABLESPACE my_nvme LOCATION '/opt/nvme'; In order to create a new table on the tablespace, specify the TABLESPACE option at the CREATE TABLE command below. CREATE TABLE my_table (...) TABLESPACE my_nvme; Or, use ALTER DATABASE command as follows, to change the default tablespace of the database. Note that tablespace of the existing tables are not changed in thie case. ALTER DATABASE my_database SET TABLESPACE my_nvme; Operations Distance between GPU and NVME-SSD On selection of server hardware and installation of GPU and NVME-SSD, hardware configuration needs to pay attention to the distance between devices, to pull out maximum performance of the device. NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA , basis of the GPU Direct SQL mechanism, requires both of the edge devices of P2P DMA are connected on the same PCIe root complex. In the other words, unable to configure the P2P DMA traverses QPI between CPUs when NVME-SSD is attached on CPU1 and GPU is attached on CPU2 at dual socket system. From standpoint of the performance, it is recommended to use dedicated PCIe-switch to connect both of the devices more than the PCIe controller built in CPU. The photo below is a motherboard of HPC server. It has 8 of PCIe x16 slots, and each pair is linked to the other over the PCIe switch. The slots in the left-side of the photo are connected to CPU1, and right-side are connected to CPU2. When a table on SSD-2 is scanned using GPU Direct SQL, the optimal GPU choice is GPU-2, and it may be able to use GPU1. However, we have to avoid to choose GPU-3 and GPU-4 due to the restriction of GPUDirect RDMA. PG-Strom calculate logical distances on any pairs of GPU and NVME-SSD using PCIe bus topology information of the system on startup time. It is displayed at the start up log. Each NVME-SSD determines the preferable GPU based on the distance, for example, GPU1 shall be used on scan of the /dev/nvme2 . $ pg_ctl restart : LOG: PG-Strom: GPU0 NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB (108 SMs; 1410MHz, L2 40960kB), RAM 39.50GB (5120bits, 1.16GHz), PCI-E Bar1 64GB, CC 8.0 LOG: [0000:41:00:0] GPU0 (NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB; GPU-13943bfd-5b30-38f5-0473-78> LOG: [0000:81:00:0] nvme0 (NGD-IN2500-080T4-C) --> GPU0 [dist=9] LOG: [0000:82:00:0] nvme2 (INTEL SSDPF2KX038TZ) --> GPU0 [dist=9] LOG: [0000:c2:00:0] nvme3 (INTEL SSDPF2KX038TZ) --> GPU0 [dist=9] LOG: [0000:c6:00:0] nvme5 (Corsair MP600 CORE) --> GPU0 [dist=9] LOG: [0000:c3:00:0] nvme4 (INTEL SSDPF2KX038TZ) --> GPU0 [dist=9] LOG: [0000:c1:00:0] nvme1 (INTEL SSDPF2KX038TZ) --> GPU0 [dist=9] LOG: [0000:c4:00:0] nvme6 (NGD-IN2500-080T4-C) --> GPU0 [dist=9] Usually automatic configuration works well. In case when NVME-over-Fabric(RDMA) is used, unable to identify the location of nvme device on the PCIe-bus, so you need to configure the logical distance between NVME-SSD and GPU manually. The example below shows the configuration of gpu2 for nvme1 , and gpu1 for nvme2 and nvme3 . It shall be added to postgresql.conf . Please note than manual configuration takes priority than the automatic configuration. pg_strom.nvme_distance_map = 'nvme1=gpu2,nvme2=gpu1,nvme3=gpu1' If the concept of distance on the PCI-E bus is not suitable, such as when running GPU-Direct SQL from a storage server connected via 100Gb Ethernet, other than a local NVME-SSD device, you can specify the directory where the storage is mounted, and the preferable GPU devices to be associated with. Below is a setting example. pg_strom.nvme_distance_map = '/mnt/0=gpu0,/mnt/1=gpu1' Controls using GUC parameters There are two GPU parameters related to GPU Direct SQL Execution. The first is pg_strom.gpudirect_enabled that simply turn on/off the function of GPU Direct SQL Execution. If off , GPU Direct SQL Execution should not be used regardless of the table size or physical location. Default is on . The other one is pg_strom.gpudirect_threshold which specifies the least table size to invoke GPU Direct SQL Execution. PG-Strom will choose GPU Direct SQL Execution when target table is located on NVME-SSD volume (or md-raid0 volume which consists of NVME-SSD only), and the table size is larger than this parameter. Its default configuration is 2GB . In other words, for obviously small tables, priority is given to reading from PostgreSQL's buffer rather than GPU-Direct SQL. Even if GPU Direct SQL Execution has advantages on a single table scan workload, usage of disk cache may work better on the second or later trial for the tables which are available to load onto the main memory. On course, this assumption is not always right depending on the workload charasteristics. Ensure usage of GPU Direct SQL Execution EXPLAIN command allows to ensure whether GPU Direct SQL Execution shall be used in the target query, or not. In the example below, a scan on the lineorder table by Custom Scan (GpuJoin) shows NVMe-Strom: enabled . In this case, GPU Direct SQL Execution shall be used to read from the lineorder table. # explain (costs off) select sum(lo_revenue), d_year, p_brand1 from lineorder, date1, part, supplier where lo_orderdate = d_datekey and lo_partkey = p_partkey and lo_suppkey = s_suppkey and p_category = 'MFGR#12' and s_region = 'AMERICA' group by d_year, p_brand1 order by d_year, p_brand1; QUERY PLAN ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate Group Key: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1 -> Sort Sort Key: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1 -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: pgstrom.psum((lo_revenue)::double precision), d_year, p_brand1 Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on lineorder GPU Projection: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1, lineorder.lo_revenue Outer Scan: lineorder Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 2406009600...97764190) HashKeys: lineorder.lo_partkey JoinQuals: (lineorder.lo_partkey = part.p_partkey) KDS-Hash (size: 10.67MB) Depth 2: GpuHashJoin (nrows 97764190...18544060) HashKeys: lineorder.lo_suppkey JoinQuals: (lineorder.lo_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey) KDS-Hash (size: 131.59MB) Depth 3: GpuHashJoin (nrows 18544060...18544060) HashKeys: lineorder.lo_orderdate JoinQuals: (lineorder.lo_orderdate = date1.d_datekey) KDS-Hash (size: 461.89KB) NVMe-Strom: enabled -> Custom Scan (GpuScan) on part GPU Projection: p_brand1, p_partkey GPU Filter: (p_category = 'MFGR#12'::bpchar) -> Custom Scan (GpuScan) on supplier GPU Projection: s_suppkey GPU Filter: (s_region = 'AMERICA'::bpchar) -> Seq Scan on date1 (31 rows) Attension for visibility map Right now, GPU routines of PG-Strom cannot run MVCC visibility checks per row, because only host code has a special data structure for visibility checks. It also leads a problem. We cannot know which row is visible, or invisible at the time when PG-Strom requires P2P DMA for NVMe-SSD, because contents of the storage blocks are not yet loaded to CPU/RAM, and MVCC related attributes are written with individual records. PostgreSQL had similar problem when it supports IndexOnlyScan. To address the problem, PostgreSQL has an infrastructure of visibility map which is a bunch of flags to indicate whether any records in a particular data block are visible from all the transactions. If associated bit is set, we can know the associated block has no invisible records without reading the block itself. GPU Direct SQL Execution utilizes this infrastructure. It checks the visibility map first, then only \"all-visible\" blocks are required to read with P2P DMA. VACUUM constructs visibility map, so you can enforce PostgreSQL to construct visibility map by explicit launch of VACUUM command.

Processor will run idle if data stream would not be delivered. GPUDirect SQL Execution directly connects NVMe-SSD which enables high-speed I/O processing by direct attach to the PCIe bus and GPU device that is also attached on the same PCIe bus, and runs SQL workloads very high speed by supplying data stream close to the wired speed of the hardware. Usually, PostgreSQL data blocks on the storage shall be once loaded to CPU/RAM through the PCIe bus, then, PostgreSQL runs WHERE-clause for filtering or JOIN/GROUP BY according to the query execution plan. Due to the characteristics of analytic workloads, the amount of result data set is much smaller than the source data set. For example, it is not rare case to read billions rows but output just hundreds rows after the aggregation operations with GROUP BY. In the other words, we consume bandwidth of the PCIe bus to move junk data, however, we cannot determine whether rows are necessary or not prior to the evaluation by SQL workloads on CPU. So, it is not avoidable restriction in usual implementation. GPU Direct SQL Execution changes the flow to read blocks from the storage sequentially. It directly loads data blocks to GPU using peer-to-peer DMA over PCIe bus, then runs SQL workloads on GPU device to reduce number of rows to be processed by CPU. In other words, it utilizes GPU as a pre-processor of SQL which locates in the middle of the storage and CPU/RAM for reduction of CPU's load, then tries to accelerate I/O processing in the results. This feature internally uses the NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage module ( nvidia-fs ) to coordinate P2P data transfer from NVME storage to GPU device memory. So, this feature requires this Linux kernel module, in addition to PG-Strom as an extension of PostgreSQL. Also note that this feature supports only NVME-SSD or NVME-oF remove devices.

This session introduces the way to collect crash dump of the PostgreSQL and PG-Strom process (CPU side) and PG-Strom's GPU kernel, and show the back trace on the serious problems. Add configuration on PostgreSQL startup For generation of crash dump (CPU-side) on process crash, you need to change the resource limitation of the operating system for size of core file PostgreSQL server process can generate. For generation of crash dump (GPU-size) on errors of GPU kernel, PostgreSQL server process has CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION environment variable, and its value has 1 . You can put a configuration file at /etc/systemd/system/postgresql-<version>.service.d/ when PostgreSQL is kicked by systemd. In case of RPM installation, a configuration file pg_strom.conf is also installed on the directory, and contains the following initial configuration. [Service] LimitNOFILE=65536 LimitCORE=infinity #Environment=CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION=1 In CUDA 9.1, it usually takes more than several minutes to generate crash dump of GPU kernel, and it entirely stops response of the PostgreSQL session which causes an error. So, we recommend to set CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION environment variable only if you investigate errors of GPU kernels which happen on a certain query. The default configuration on RPM installation comments out the line of CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION environment variable. PostgreSQL server process should have unlimited Max core file size configuration, after the next restart. You can check it as follows. # cat /proc/<PID of postmaster>/limits Limit Soft Limit Hard Limit Units : : : : Max core file size unlimited unlimited bytes : : : : Installation of debuginfo package # yum install postgresql10-debuginfo pg_strom-PG10-debuginfo : ================================================================================ Package Arch Version Repository Size ================================================================================ Installing: pg_strom-PG10-debuginfo x86_64 1.9-180301.el7 heterodb-debuginfo 766 k postgresql10-debuginfo x86_64 10.3-1PGDG.rhel7 pgdg10 9.7 M Transaction Summary ================================================================================ Install 2 Packages : Installed: pg_strom-PG10-debuginfo.x86_64 0:1.9-180301.el7 postgresql10-debuginfo.x86_64 0:10.3-1PGDG.rhel7 Complete!

The pg_strom.enabled parameter allows to turn on/off all the functionality of PG-Strom at once. The configuration below disables PG-Strom, thus identically performs with the standard PostgreSQL. # SET pg_strom.enabled = off; In addition, we provide parameters to disable particular execution plan like GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg.

For generation of crash dump (GPU-size) on errors of GPU kernel, PostgreSQL server process has CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION environment variable, and its value has 1 . You can put a configuration file at /etc/systemd/system/postgresql-<version>.service.d/ when PostgreSQL is kicked by systemd.
