PG-Strom is an extension module of PostgreSQL designed for version 9.6 or later. By utilization of GPU (Graphic Processor Unit) device which has thousands cores per chip, it enables to accelerate SQL workloads for data analytics or batch processing to big data set. Its core features are GPU code generator that automatically generates GPU program according to the SQL commands and asynchronous parallel execution engine to run SQL workloads on GPU device. The latest version supports SCAN (evaluation of WHERE-clause), JOIN and GROUP BY workloads. In the case when GPU-processing has advantage, PG-Strom replaces the vanilla implementation of PostgreSQL and transparentlly works from users and applications. Unlike some DWH systems, PG-Strom shares the storage system of PostgreSQL which saves data in row-format. It is not always best choice for summary or analytics workloads, however, it is also an advantage as well. Users don't need to export and transform the data from transactional database for processing. PG-Strom v2.0 enhanced the capability of reading from storage. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL mechanism allows to load from storage (NVME-SSD) to GPU directly, and supply data to GPU that runs SQL workloads. On the other hands, the feature of PL/CUDA and gstore_fdw allows to run highly computing density problems, like advanced statistical analytics or machine learning, on the database management system, and to return only results to users.

It collocates date of a row closely, so it works effectively for INSERT/UPDATE-major workloads, but not suitable for summarizing or analytics of mass-data. It is not usual to reference all the columns in a table on mass-data processing, and we tend to reference a part of columns in most cases. In this case, the storage I/O bandwidth consumed by unreferenced columns are waste, however, we have no easy way to fetch only particular columns referenced from the row-oriented data structure. In case of column oriented data structure, in an opposite manner, it has extreme disadvantage on INSERT/UPDATE-major workloads, however, it can pull out maximum performance of storage I/O on mass-data processing workloads because it can loads only referenced columns. From the standpoint of processor efficiency also, column-oriented data structure looks like a flat array that pulls out maximum bandwidth of memory subsystem for GPU, by special memory access pattern called Coalesced Memory Access. What is Apache Arrow? Apache Arrow is a data format of structured data to save in columnar-form and to exchange other applications. Some applications for big-data processing support the format, and it is easy for self-developed applications to use Apache Arrow format since they provides libraries for major programming languages like C,C++ or Python. Apache Arrow format file internally contains Schema portion to define data structure, and one or more RecordBatch to save columnar-data based on the schema definition. For data types, it supports integers, strint (variable-length), date/time types and so on. Indivisual columnar data has its internal representation according to the data types. Data representation in Apache Arrow is not identical with the representation in PostgreSQL. For example, epoch of timestamp in Arrow is 1970-01-01 and it supports multiple precision. On the other hands, epoch of timestamp in PostgreSQL is 2001-01-01 and it has microseconds accuracy. Arrow_Fdw allows to read Apache Arrow files on PostgreSQL using foreign table mechanism. If an Arrow file contains 8 of record batches that has million items for each column data, for example, we can access 8 million rows on the Arrow files through the foreign table. Operations Creation of foreign tables Usually it takes the 3 steps below to create a foreign table. Define a foreign-data-wrapper using CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER command Define a foreign server using CREATE SERVER command Define a foreign table using CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command The first 2 steps above are included in the CREATE EXTENSION pg_strom command. All you need to run individually is CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command last. CREATE FOREIGN TABLE flogdata ( ts timestamp, sensor_id int, signal1 smallint, signal2 smallint, signal3 smallint, signal4 smallint, ) SERVER arrow_fdw OPTIONS (file '/path/to/logdata.arrow'); Data type of columns specified by the CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command must be matched to schema definition of the Arrow files to be mapped. Arrow_Fdw also supports a useful manner using IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA statement. It automatically generates a foreign table definition using schema definition of the Arrow files. It specifies the foreign table name, schema name to import, and path name of the Arrow files using OPTION-clause. Schema definition of Arrow files contains data types and optional column name for each column. It declares a new foreign table using these information. IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA flogdata FROM SERVER arrow_fdw INTO public OPTIONS (file '/path/to/logdata.arrow'); Foreign table options Arrow_Fdw supports the options below. Right now, all the options are for foreign tables. Target Option Description foreign table file It maps an Arrow file specified on the foreign table. foreign table files It maps multiple Arrow files specified by comma (,) separated files list on the foreign table. foreign table dir It maps all the Arrow files in the directory specified on the foreign table. foreign table suffix When dir option is given, it maps only files with the specified suffix, like .arrow for example. foreign table parallel_workers It tells the number of workers that should be used to assist a parallel scan of this foreign table; equivalent to parallel_workers storage parameter at normal tables. foreign table writable It allows execution of INSERT command on the foreign table. See the section of \"Writable Arrow_Fdw\" Data type mapping Arrow data types are mapped on PostgreSQL data types as follows. Arrow data types PostgreSQL data types Remarks Int int2,int4,int8 is_signed attribute is ignored. bitWidth attribute supports only 16,32 or 64. FloatingPoint float2,float4,float8 float2 is enhanced by PG-Strom. Binary bytea Utf8 text Decimal numeric Date date Adjusted as if unitsz=Day Time time Adjusted as if unitsz=MicroSecond Timestamp timestamp Adjusted as if unitsz=MicroSecond Interval interval List array of base type It supports only 1-dimensional List(WIP). Struct composite type PG composite type must be preliminary defined. Union -------- FixedSizeBinary char(n) FixedSizeList -------- Map -------- How to read EXPLAIN EXPLAIN command show us information about Arrow files reading. The example below is an output of query execution plan that includes flineorder foreign table that mapps an Arrow file of 309GB. =# EXPLAIN SELECT sum(lo_extendedprice*lo_discount) as revenue FROM flineorder,date1 WHERE lo_orderdate = d_datekey AND d_year = 1993 AND lo_discount between 1 and 3 AND lo_quantity < 25; QUERY PLAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aggregate (cost=12632759.02..12632759.03 rows=1 width=32) -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=12632754.43..12632757.49 rows=204 width=8) Reduction: NoGroup Combined GpuJoin: enabled GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on flineorder (cost=9952.15..12638126.98 rows=572635 width=12) Outer Scan: flineorder (cost=9877.70..12649677.69 rows=4010017 width=16) Outer Scan Filter: ((lo_discount >= 1) AND (lo_discount <= 3) AND (lo_quantity < 25)) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 4010017...572635) HashKeys: flineorder.lo_orderdate JoinQuals: (flineorder.lo_orderdate = date1.d_datekey) KDS-Hash (size: 66.06KB) GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) NVMe-Strom: enabled referenced: lo_orderdate, lo_quantity, lo_extendedprice, lo_discount files0: /opt/nvme/lineorder_s401.arrow (size: 309.23GB) -> Seq Scan on date1 (cost=0.00..78.95 rows=365 width=4) Filter: (d_year = 1993) (18 rows) According to the EXPLAIN output, we can see Custom Scan (GpuJoin) scans flineorder foreign table. file0 item shows the filename ( /opt/nvme/lineorder_s401.arrow ) on behalf of the foreign table and its size. If multiple files are mapped, any files are individually shown, like file1 , file2 , ... The referenced item shows the list of referenced columns. We can see this query touches lo_orderdate , lo_quantity , lo_extendedprice and lo_discount columns. In addition, GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) and NVMe-Strom: enabled shows us the scan on flineorder uses SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL mechanism.

The load of lo_orderdate , lo_quantity , lo_extendedprice and lo_discount columns needs to read 87.4GB in total. It is 28.3% towards the filesize (309.2GB). How to make Arrow files This section introduces the way to transform dataset already stored in PostgreSQL database system into Apache Arrow file. Using PyArrow+Pandas A pair of PyArrow module, developed by Arrow developers community, and Pandas data frame can dump PostgreSQL database into an Arrow file. The example below reads all the data in table t0 , then write out them into /tmp/t0.arrow . import pyarrow as pa import pandas as pd X = pd.read_sql(sql=\"SELECT * FROM t0\", con=\"postgresql://localhost/postgres\") Y = pa.Table.from_pandas(X) f = pa.RecordBatchFileWriter('/tmp/t0.arrow', Y.schema) f.write_table(Y,1000000) # RecordBatch for each million rows f.close() Please note that the above operation once keeps query result of the SQL on memory, so should pay attention on memory consumption if you want to transfer massive rows at once. Using Pg2Arrow On the other hand, pg2arrow command, developed by PG-Strom Development Team, enables us to write out query result into Arrow file. This tool is designed to write out massive amount of data into storage device like NVME-SSD. It fetch query results from PostgreSQL database system, and write out Record Batches of Arrow format for each data size specified by the -s|--segment-size option. Thus, its memory consumption is relatively reasonable. pg2arrow command is distributed with PG-Strom. It shall be installed on the bin directory of PostgreSQL related utilities. $ ./pg2arrow --help Usage: pg2arrow [OPTION]... [DBNAME [USERNAME]] General options: -d, --dbname=DBNAME database name to connect to -c, --command=COMMAND SQL command to run -f, --file=FILENAME SQL command from file (-c and -f are exclusive, either of them must be specified) -o, --output=FILENAME result file in Apache Arrow format --append=FILENAME result file to be appended --output and --append are exclusive to use at the same time. If neither of them are specified, it creates a temporary file.) Arrow format options: -s, --segment-size=SIZE size of record batch for each (default: 256MB) Connection options: -h, --host=HOSTNAME database server host -p, --port=PORT database server port -U, --username=USERNAME database user name -w, --no-password never prompt for password -W, --password force password prompt Other options: --dump=FILENAME dump information of arrow file --progress shows progress of the job --set=NAME:VALUE GUC option to set before SQL execution Report bugs to <pgstrom@heterodbcom>. The -h or -U option specifies the connection parameters of PostgreSQL, like psql or pg_dump . The simplest usage of this command is running a SQL command specified by -c|--command option on PostgreSQL server, then write out results into the file specified by -o|--output option in Arrow format. --append option is available, instead of -o|--output option. It means appending data to existing Apache Arrow file. In this case, the target Apache Arrow file must have fully identical schema definition towards the specified SQL command. The example below reads all the data in table t0 , then write out them into the file /tmp/t0.arrow . $ pg2arrow -U kaigai -d postgres -c \"SELECT * FROM t0\" -o /tmp/t0.arrow Although it is an option for developers, --dump <filename> prints schema definition and record-batch location and size of Arrow file in human readable form. --progress option enables to show progress of the task. It is useful when a huge table is transformed to Apache Arrow format. Writable Arrow_Fdw Arrow_Fdw foreign tables that have writable option allow to append data using INSERT command, and to erase entire contents of the foreign table (that is Apache Arrow file on behalf of the foreign table) using pgstrom.arrow_fdw_truncate() function. On the other hand, UPDATE and DELETE commands are not supported. In case of writable option was enabled on Arrow_Fdw foreign tables, it accepts only one pathname specified by the file or files option. You cannot specify multiple pathnames, and exclusive to the dir option. It does not require that the Apache Arrow file actually exists on the specified path at the foreign table declaration time, on the other hands, PostgreSQL server needs to have permission to create a new file on the path. The diagram above introduces the internal layout of Apache Arrow files. In addition to the metadata like header or footer, it can have multiple DictionayBatch (dictionary data for dictionary compression) and RecordBatch (user data) chunks. RecordBatch is a unit of columnar data that have a particular number of rows. For example, on the Apache Arrow file that have x , y and z fields, when RecordBatch[0] contains 2,500 rows, it means 2,500 items of x , y and z fields are located at the RecordBatch[0] in columnar format. Also, when RecordBatch[1] contains 4,000 rows, it also means 4,000 items of x , y and z fields are located at the RecordBatch[1] in columnar format. Therefore, appending user data to Apache Arrow file is addition of a new RecordBatch. On Apache Arrow files, the file offset information towards DictionaryBatch and RecordBatch are internally held by the Footer chunk, which is next to the last RecordBatch. So, we can overwrite the original Footer chunk by the (k+1)th RecordBatch when INSERT command appends new data, then reconstruct a new Footer. Due to the data format, the newly appended RecordBatch has rows processed by the single INSERT command. So, it makes the file usage worst efficiency if an INSERT command added only a few rows. We recommend to insert as many rows as possible by a single INSERT command, when you add data to Arrow_Fdw foreign table. Write operations to Arrow_Fdw follows transaction control of PostgreSQL. No concurrent transactions can reference the rows newly appended until its commit, and user can rollback the pending written data, which is uncommited. Due to the implementation reason, writes to Arrow_Fdw foreign table acquires ShareRowExclusiveLock , although INSERT or UPDATE on regular PostgreSQL tables acquire RowExclusiveLock . It means only 1 transaction can write to a particular Arrow_Fdw foreign table concurrently. It is not a problem usually because the workloads Arrow_Fdw expects are mostly bulk data loading. When you design many concurrent transaction try to write Arrow_Fdw foreign table, we recomment to use a temporary table for many small writes. postgres=# CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ftest (x int) SERVER arrow_fdw OPTIONS (file '/dev/shm/ftest.arrow', writable 'true'); CREATE FOREIGN TABLE postgres=# INSERT INTO ftest (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,100)); INSERT 0 100 postgres=# BEGIN; BEGIN postgres=# INSERT INTO ftest (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,50)); INSERT 0 50 postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 150 (1 row) -- By the transaction rollback, the above INSERT shall be reverted. postgres=# ROLLBACK; ROLLBACK postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 100 (1 row) Right now, PostgreSQL does not support TRUNCATE statement on foreign tables. As an alternative, Arrow_Fdw provide pgstrom.arrow_fdw_truncate(regclass) function that eliminates all the contents of Apache Arrow file on behalf of the foreign table. postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 100 (1 row) postgres=# SELECT pgstrom.arrow_fdw_truncate('ftest'); arrow_fdw_truncate -------------------- (1 row) postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 0 (1 row) Advanced Usage SSDtoGPU Direct SQL In case when all the Arrow files mapped on the Arrow_Fdw foreign table satisfies the terms below, PG-Strom enables SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL to load columnar data. Arrow files are on NVME-SSD volume. NVME-SSD volume is managed by Ext4 filesystem. Total size of Arrow files exceeds the pg_strom.nvme_strom_threshold configuration. Partition configuration Arrow_Fdw foreign tables can be used as a part of partition leafs. Usual PostgreSQL tables can be mixtured with Arrow_Fdw foreign tables. So, pay attention Arrow_Fdw foreign table does not support any writer operations. And, make boundary condition of the partition consistent to the contents of the mapped Arrow file. It is a responsibility of the database administrators. A typical usage scenario is processing of long-standing accumulated log-data. Unlike transactional data, log-data is mostly write-once and will never be updated / deleted. Thus, by migration of the log-data after a lapse of certain period into Arrow_Fdw foreign table that is read-only but rapid processing, we can accelerate summarizing and analytics workloads. In addition, log-data likely have timestamp, so it is quite easy design to add partition leafs periodically, like monthly, weekly or others. The example below defines a partitioned table that mixes a normal PostgreSQL table and Arrow_Fdw foreign tables.

On the other hand, UPDATE and DELETE commands are not supported. In case of writable option was enabled on Arrow_Fdw foreign tables, it accepts only one pathname specified by the file or files option. You cannot specify multiple pathnames, and exclusive to the dir option. It does not require that the Apache Arrow file actually exists on the specified path at the foreign table declaration time, on the other hands, PostgreSQL server needs to have permission to create a new file on the path. The diagram above introduces the internal layout of Apache Arrow files. In addition to the metadata like header or footer, it can have multiple DictionayBatch (dictionary data for dictionary compression) and RecordBatch (user data) chunks. RecordBatch is a unit of columnar data that have a particular number of rows. For example, on the Apache Arrow file that have x , y and z fields, when RecordBatch[0] contains 2,500 rows, it means 2,500 items of x , y and z fields are located at the RecordBatch[0] in columnar format. Also, when RecordBatch[1] contains 4,000 rows, it also means 4,000 items of x , y and z fields are located at the RecordBatch[1] in columnar format. Therefore, appending user data to Apache Arrow file is addition of a new RecordBatch. On Apache Arrow files, the file offset information towards DictionaryBatch and RecordBatch are internally held by the Footer chunk, which is next to the last RecordBatch. So, we can overwrite the original Footer chunk by the (k+1)th RecordBatch when INSERT command appends new data, then reconstruct a new Footer. Due to the data format, the newly appended RecordBatch has rows processed by the single INSERT command. So, it makes the file usage worst efficiency if an INSERT command added only a few rows. We recommend to insert as many rows as possible by a single INSERT command, when you add data to Arrow_Fdw foreign table. Write operations to Arrow_Fdw follows transaction control of PostgreSQL. No concurrent transactions can reference the rows newly appended until its commit, and user can rollback the pending written data, which is uncommited. Due to the implementation reason, writes to Arrow_Fdw foreign table acquires ShareRowExclusiveLock , although INSERT or UPDATE on regular PostgreSQL tables acquire RowExclusiveLock . It means only 1 transaction can write to a particular Arrow_Fdw foreign table concurrently. It is not a problem usually because the workloads Arrow_Fdw expects are mostly bulk data loading. When you design many concurrent transaction try to write Arrow_Fdw foreign table, we recomment to use a temporary table for many small writes. postgres=# CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ftest (x int) SERVER arrow_fdw OPTIONS (file '/dev/shm/ftest.arrow', writable 'true'); CREATE FOREIGN TABLE postgres=# INSERT INTO ftest (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,100)); INSERT 0 100 postgres=# BEGIN; BEGIN postgres=# INSERT INTO ftest (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,50)); INSERT 0 50 postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 150 (1 row) -- By the transaction rollback, the above INSERT shall be reverted. postgres=# ROLLBACK; ROLLBACK postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 100 (1 row) Right now, PostgreSQL does not support TRUNCATE statement on foreign tables.

Checklist Server Hardware It requires generic x86_64 hardware that can run Linux operating system supported by CUDA Toolkit. We have no special requirement for CPU, storage and network devices. note002:HW Validation List may help you to choose the hardware. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution needs SSD devices which support NVMe specification, and to be installed under the same PCIe Root Complex where GPU is located on. GPU Device PG-Strom requires at least one GPU device on the system, which is supported by CUDA Toolkit, has computing capability 6.0 (Pascal generation) or later; note001:GPU Availability Matrix shows more detailed information. Check this list for the support status of SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. Operating System PG-Strom requires Linux operating system for x86_64 architecture, and its distribution supported by CUDA Toolkit. Our recommendation is Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS version 7.x series. - SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution needs Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS version 7.3 or later. PostgreSQL PG-Strom requires PostgreSQL version 9.6 or later. PostgreSQL v9.6 renew the custom-scan interface for CPU-parallel execution or GROUP BY planning, thus, it allows cooperation of custom-plans provides by extension modules. CUDA Toolkit PG-Strom requires CUDA Toolkit version 9.2 or later. Some of CUDA Driver APIs used by PG-Strom internally are not included in the former versions. OS Installation Choose a Linux distribution which is supported by CUDA Toolkit, then install the system according to the installation process of the distribution. NVIDIA DEVELOPER ZONE introduces the list of Linux distributions which are supported by CUDA Toolkit. In case of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x or CentOS 7.x series, choose \"Minimal installation\" as base environment, and also check the following add-ons. Debugging Tools Development Tools Post OS Installation Configuration Next to the OS installation, a few additionsl configurations are required to install GPU-drivers and NVMe-Strom driver on the later steps. Setup EPEL Repository Several software modules required by PG-Strom are distributed as a part of EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux). You need to add a repository definition of EPEL packages for yum system to obtain these software. One of the package we will get from EPEL repository is DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support). It is a framework to build Linux kernel module for the running Linux kernel on demand; used for NVIDIA's GPU driver or NVMe-Strom which is a kernel module to support SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. epel-release package provides the repository definition of EPEL. You can obtain this package from the public FTP site of Fedora Project. Downloads the epel-release-<distribution version>.noarch.rpm , and install the package. Once epel-release package gets installed, yum system configuration is updated to get software from the EPEL repository. Fedora Project Public FTP Site https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/ Tip Walk down the directory: Packages --> e , from the above URL. Install the epel-release package as follows. $ sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/epel-release-7-11.noarch.rpm : ================================================================================ Package Arch Version Repository Size ================================================================================ Installing: epel-release noarch 7-11 /epel-release-7-11.noarch 24 k Transaction Summary ================================================================================ Install 1 Package : Installed: epel-release.noarch 0:7-11 Complete! HeteroDB-SWDC Installation PG-Strom and related packages are distributed from HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . You need to add a repository definition of HeteroDB-SWDC for you system to obtain these software. heterodb-swdc package provides the repository definition of HeteroDB-SWDC. Access to the HeteroDB Software Distribution Center using Web browser, download the heterodb-swdc-1.0-1.el7.noarch.rpm on top of the file list, then install this package. Once heterodb-swdc package gets installed, yum system configuration is updated to get software from the HeteroDB-SWDC repository. Install the heterodb-swdc package as follows. $ sudo yum install https://heterodb.github.io/swdc/yum/rhel7-x86_64/heterodb-swdc-1.0-1.el7.noarch.rpm : ================================================================================ Package Arch Version Repository Size ================================================================================ Installing: heterodb-swdc noarch 1.0-1.el7 /heterodb-swdc-1.0-1.el7.noarch 2.4 k Transaction Summary ================================================================================ Install 1 Package : Installed: heterodb-swdc.noarch 0:1.0-1.el7 Complete! CUDA Toolkit Installation This section introduces the installation of CUDA Toolkit. If you already installed the latest CUDA Toolkit, you can skip this section. NVIDIA offers two approach to install CUDA Toolkit; one is by self-extracting archive (called runfile), and the other is by RPM packages. We recommend RPM installation because it allows simple software updates. You can download the installation package for CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA DEVELOPER ZONE. Choose your OS, architecture, distribution and version, then choose \"rpm(network)\" edition. The \"rpm(network)\" edition contains only yum repositoty definition to distribute CUDA Toolkit. It is similar to the EPEL repository definition at the OS installation. So, you needs to installa the related RPM packages over network after the resistoration of CUDA repository. Run the following command. $ sudo rpm -i cuda-repo-<distribution>-<version>.x86_64.rpm $ sudo yum clean all $ sudo yum install cuda --enablerepo=rhel-7-server-e4s-optional-rpms or $ sudo yum install cuda Once installation completed successfully, CUDA Toolkit is deployed at /usr/local/cuda . Tip RHEL7 does not enable rhel-7-server-e4s-optional-rpms repository in the default. It distributes vulkan-filesystem packaged required by CUDA Toolkit installation. When you kick installation of CUDA Toolkit, edit /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo to enable the repository, or use --enablerepo option of yum command to resolve dependency. $ ls /usr/local/cuda bin include libnsight nvml samples tools doc jre libnvvp nvvm share version.txt extras lib64 nsightee_plugins pkgconfig src Once installation gets completed, ensure the system recognizes the GPU devices correctly. nvidia-smi command shows GPU information installed on your system, as follows. $ nvidia-smi Wed Feb 14 09:43:48 2018 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 387.26 Driver Version: 387.26 | |-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M| Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

In this case, reboot the operating system after a configuration to disable the nouveau driver. If CUDA Toolkit is installed by the runfile installer, it also disables the nouveau driver. Elsewhere, in case of RPM installation, do the following configuration. To disable the nouveau driver, put the following configuration onto /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nouveau.conf , then run dracut command to apply them on the boot image of Linux kernel. # cat > /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nouveau.conf <<EOF blacklist nouveau options nouveau modeset=0 EOF # dracut -f PostgreSQL Installation This section introduces PostgreSQL installation with RPM. We don't introduce the installation steps from the source because there are many documents for this approach, and there are also various options for the ./configure script. PostgreSQL is also distributed in the packages of Linux distributions, however, it is not the latest one, and often older than the version which supports PG-Strom. For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x or CentOS 7.x distributes PostgreSQL v9.2.x series. This version had been EOL by the PostgreSQL community. PostgreSQL Global Development Group provides yum repository to distribute the latest PostgreSQL and related packages. Like the configuration of EPEL, you can install a small package to set up yum repository, then install PostgreSQL and related software. Here is the list of yum repository definition: http://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php . Repository definitions are per PostgreSQL major version and Linux distribution. You need to choose the one for your Linux distribution, and for PostgreSQL v9.6 or later. All you need to install are yum repository definition, and PostgreSQL packages. If you choose PostgreSQL v10, the pakages below are required to install PG-Strom. postgresql10-devel postgresql10-server $ sudo yum install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat10-10-2.noarch.rpm $ sudo yum install -y postgresql10-server postgresql10-devel : ================================================================================ Package Arch Version Repository Size ================================================================================ Installing: postgresql10-devel x86_64 10.2-1PGDG.rhel7 pgdg10 2.0 M postgresql10-server x86_64 10.2-1PGDG.rhel7 pgdg10 4.4 M Installing for dependencies: postgresql10 x86_64 10.2-1PGDG.rhel7 pgdg10 1.5 M postgresql10-libs x86_64 10.2-1PGDG.rhel7 pgdg10 354 k Transaction Summary ================================================================================ Install 2 Packages (+2 Dependent packages) : Installed: postgresql10-devel.x86_64 0:10.2-1PGDG.rhel7 postgresql10-server.x86_64 0:10.2-1PGDG.rhel7 Dependency Installed: postgresql10.x86_64 0:10.2-1PGDG.rhel7 postgresql10-libs.x86_64 0:10.2-1PGDG.rhel7 Complete! The RPM packages provided by PostgreSQL Global Development Group installs software under the /usr/pgsql-<version> directory, so you may pay attention whether the PATH environment variable is configured appropriately. postgresql-alternative package set up symbolic links to the related commands under /usr/local/bin , so allows to simplify the operations. Also, it enables to switch target version using alternatives command even if multiple version of PostgreSQL. $ sudo yum install postgresql-alternatives : Resolving Dependencies --> Running transaction check ---> Package postgresql-alternatives.noarch 0:1.0-1.el7 will be installed --> Finished Dependency Resolution Dependencies Resolved : ================================================================================ Package Arch Version Repository Size ================================================================================ Installing: postgresql-alternatives noarch 1.0-1.el7 heterodb 9.2 k Transaction Summary ================================================================================ : Installed: postgresql-alternatives.noarch 0:1.0-1.el7 Complete! PG-Strom Installation RPM Installation PG-Strom and related packages are distributed from HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . If you repository definition has been added, not many tasks are needed. We provide individual RPM packages of PG-Strom for each base PostgreSQL version. pg_strom-PG96 package is built for PostgreSQL 9.6, and pg_strom-PG10 is also built for PostgreSQL v10. $ sudo yum install pg_strom-PG10 : ================================================================================ Package Arch Version Repository Size ================================================================================ Installing: pg_strom-PG10 x86_64 1.9-180301.el7 heterodb 320 k Transaction Summary ================================================================================ : Installed: pg_strom-PG10.x86_64 0:1.9-180301.el7 Complete! That's all for package installation. Installation from the source For developers, we also introduces the steps to build and install PG-Strom from the source code. Getting the source code Like RPM packages, you can download tarball of the source code from HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . On the other hands, here is a certain time-lags to release the tarball, it may be preferable to checkout the master branch of PG-Strom on GitHub to use the latest development branch. $ git clone https://github.com/heterodb/pg-strom.git Cloning into 'pg-strom'... remote: Counting objects: 13797, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (215/215), done. remote: Total 13797 (delta 208), reused 339 (delta 167), pack-reused 13400 Receiving objects: 100% (13797/13797), 11.81 MiB | 1.76 MiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (10504/10504), done. Building the PG-Strom Configuration to build PG-Strom must match to the target PostgreSQL strictly. For example, if a particular strcut has inconsistent layout by the configuration at build, it may lead problematic bugs; not easy to find out. Thus, not to have inconsistency, PG-Strom does not have own configure script, but references the build configuration of PostgreSQL using pg_config command. If PATH environment variable is set to the pg_config command of the target PostgreSQL, run make and make install . Elsewhere, give PG_CONFIG=... parameter on make command to tell the full path of the pg_config command. $ cd pg-strom $ make PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-10/bin/pg_config $ sudo make install PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-10/bin/pg_config Post Installation Setup Creation of database cluster Database cluster is not constructed yet, run initdb command to set up initial database of PostgreSQL. The default path of the database cluster on RPM installation is /var/lib/pgsql/<version number>/data . If you install postgresql-alternatives package, this default path can be referenced by /var/lib/pgdata regardless of the PostgreSQL version. $ sudo su - postgres $ initdb -D /var/lib/pgdata/ The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user \"postgres\". This user must also own the server process. The database cluster will be initialized with locale \"en_US.UTF-8\". The default database encoding has accordingly been set to \"UTF8\". The default text search configuration will be set to \"english\". Data page checksums are disabled. fixing permissions on existing directory /var/lib/pgdata ... ok creating subdirectories ... ok selecting default max_connections ... 100 selecting default shared_buffers ... 128MB selecting dynamic shared memory implementation ... posix creating configuration files ... ok running bootstrap script ... ok performing post-bootstrap initialization ... ok syncing data to disk ... ok WARNING: enabling \"trust\" authentication for local connections You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or --auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb. Success. You can now start the database server using: pg_ctl -D /var/lib/pgdata/ -l logfile start Setup postgresql.conf Next, edit postgresql.conf which is a configuration file of PostgreSQL. The parameters below should be edited at least to work PG-Strom. Investigate other parameters according to usage of the system and expected workloads. shared_preload_libraries PG-Strom module must be loaded on startup of the postmaster process by the shared_preload_libraries . Unable to load it on demand. Therefore, you must add the configuration below. shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/pg_strom' max_worker_processes PG-Strom internally uses several background workers, so the default configuration (= 8) is too small for other usage. So, we recommand to expand the variable for a certain margin. max_worker_processes = 100 shared_buffers Although it depends on the workloads, the initial configuration of shared_buffers is too small for the data size where PG-Strom tries to work, thus storage workloads restricts the entire performance, and may be unable to work GPU efficiently. So, we recommend to expand the variable for a certain margin. shared_buffers = 10GB Please consider to apply SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution to process larger than system's physical RAM size. work_mem Although it depends on the workloads, the initial configuration of work_mem is too small to choose the optimal query execution plan on analytic queries. An typical example is, disk-based merge sort may be chosen instead of the in-memory quick-sorting. So, we recommend to expand the variable for a certain margin. work_mem = 1GB Expand OS resource limits SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL especially tries to open many files simultaneously, so resource limit for number of file descriptors per process should be expanded. Also, we recommend not to limit core file size to generate core dump of PostgreSQL certainly on system crash. If PostgreSQL service is launched by systemd, you can put the configurations of resource limit at /etc/systemd/system/postgresql-XX.service.d/pg_strom.conf . RPM installation setups the configuration below by the default. It comments out configuration to the environment variable CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION . This is a developer option that enables to generate GPU's core dump on any CUDA/GPU level errors, if enabled. See CUDA-GDB:GPU core dump support for more details. [Service] LimitNOFILE=65536 LimitCORE=infinity #Environment=CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION=1 Start PostgreSQL Start PostgreSQL service. If PG-Strom is set up appropriately, it writes out log message which shows PG-Strom recognized GPU devices.

Parameter Type Default Description verbose int 0 Enables detailed debug output fast_ssd_mode int 0 Operating mode for fast NVME-SSD p2p_dma_max_depth int 1024 Maximum number of asynchronous P2P DMA request can be enqueued on the I/O-queue of NVME device p2p_dma_max_unitsz int 256 Maximum length of data blocks, in kB, to be read by a single P2P DMA request at once Here is an extra explanation for fast_ssd_mode parameter. When NVME-Strom Linux kernel module get a request for SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer, first of all, it checks whether the required data blocks are caches on page-caches of operating system. If fast_ssd_mode is 0 , NVME-Strom once writes back page caches of the required data blocks to the userspace buffer of the caller, then indicates application to invoke normal host-->device data transfer by CUDA API. It is suitable for non-fast NVME-SSDs such as PCIe x4 grade. On the other hands, SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer may be faster, if you use PCIe x8 grade fast NVME-SSD or use multiple SSDs in striping mode, than normal host-->device data transfer after the buffer copy. If fast_ssd_mode is not 0 , NVME-Strom kicks SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer regardless of the page cache state. However, it shall never kicks SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer if page cache is dirty. Here is an extra explanation for p2p_dma_max_depth parameter. NVME-Strom Linux kernel module makes DMA requests for SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer, then enqueues them to I/O-queue of the source NVME devices. When asynchronous DMA requests are enqueued more than the capacity of NVME devices, latency of individual DMA requests become terrible because NVME-SSD controler processes the DMA requests in order of arrival. (On the other hands, it maximizes the throughput because NVME-SSD controler receives DMA requests continuously.) If turn-around time of the DMA requests are too large, it may be wrongly considered as errors, then can lead timeout of I/O request and return an error status. Thus, it makes no sense to enqueue more DMA requests to the I/O-queue more than the reasonable amount of pending requests for full usage of NVME devices. p2p_dma_max_depth parameter controls number of asynchronous P2P DMA requests that can be enqueued at once per NVME device. If application tries to enqueue DMA requests more than the configuration, the caller thread will block until completion of the running DMA. So, it enables to avoid unintentional high-load of NVME devices.","title":"Install"},{"location":"install/#checklist","text":"Server Hardware It requires generic x86_64 hardware that can run Linux operating system supported by CUDA Toolkit.

Parameter Type Default Description verbose int 0 Enables detailed debug output fast_ssd_mode int 0 Operating mode for fast NVME-SSD p2p_dma_max_depth int 1024 Maximum number of asynchronous P2P DMA request can be enqueued on the I/O-queue of NVME device p2p_dma_max_unitsz int 256 Maximum length of data blocks, in kB, to be read by a single P2P DMA request at once Here is an extra explanation for fast_ssd_mode parameter. When NVME-Strom Linux kernel module get a request for SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer, first of all, it checks whether the required data blocks are caches on page-caches of operating system. If fast_ssd_mode is 0 , NVME-Strom once writes back page caches of the required data blocks to the userspace buffer of the caller, then indicates application to invoke normal host-->device data transfer by CUDA API. It is suitable for non-fast NVME-SSDs such as PCIe x4 grade. On the other hands, SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer may be faster, if you use PCIe x8 grade fast NVME-SSD or use multiple SSDs in striping mode, than normal host-->device data transfer after the buffer copy. If fast_ssd_mode is not 0 , NVME-Strom kicks SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer regardless of the page cache state. However, it shall never kicks SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer if page cache is dirty. Here is an extra explanation for p2p_dma_max_depth parameter. NVME-Strom Linux kernel module makes DMA requests for SSD-to-GPU direct data transfer, then enqueues them to I/O-queue of the source NVME devices. When asynchronous DMA requests are enqueued more than the capacity of NVME devices, latency of individual DMA requests become terrible because NVME-SSD controler processes the DMA requests in order of arrival. (On the other hands, it maximizes the throughput because NVME-SSD controler receives DMA requests continuously.) If turn-around time of the DMA requests are too large, it may be wrongly considered as errors, then can lead timeout of I/O request and return an error status. Thus, it makes no sense to enqueue more DMA requests to the I/O-queue more than the reasonable amount of pending requests for full usage of NVME devices. p2p_dma_max_depth parameter controls number of asynchronous P2P DMA requests that can be enqueued at once per NVME device. If application tries to enqueue DMA requests more than the configuration, the caller thread will block until completion of the running DMA. So, it enables to avoid unintentional high-load of NVME devices.","title":"Kernel module parameters"},{"location":"operations/","text":"Basic operations Confirmation of GPU off-loading You can use EXPLAIN command to check whether query is executed on GPU device or not. A query is internally split into multiple elements and executed, and PG-Strom is capable to run SCAN, JOIN and GROUP BY in parallel on GPU device.

GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg are implemented on the CustomScan mechanism. In this example, GpuJoin runs JOIN operation on t0 , t1 and t1 , then GpuPreAgg which receives the result of GpuJoin runs GROUP BY operation by the cat column on GPU device. PG-Strom interacts with the query optimizer during PostgreSQL is building a query execution plan, and it offers alternative query execution plan with estimated cost for PostgreSQL's optimizer, if any of SCAN, JOIN, or GROUP BY are executable on GPU device. This estimated cost is better than other query execution plans that run on CPU, it chooses the alternative execution plan that shall run on GPU device. For GPU execution, it requires operators, functions and data types in use must be supported by PG-Strom. It supports numeric types like int or float , date and time types like date or timestamp , variable length string like text and so on. It also supports arithmetic operations, comparison operators and many built-in operators. See References for the detailed list. CPU+GPU Hybrid Parallel PG-Strom also supports PostgreSQL's CPU parallel execution. In the CPU parallel execution mode, Gather node launches several background worker processes, then it gathers the result of \"partial\" execution by individual background workers. CustomScan execution plan provided by PG-Strom, like GpuJoin or GpuPreAgg, support execution at the background workers. They process their partial task using GPU individually. A CPU core usually needs much more time to set up buffer to supply data for GPU than execution of SQL workloads on GPU, so hybrid usage of CPU and GPU parallel can expect higher performance. On the other hands, each process creates CUDA context that is required to communicate GPU and consumes a certain amount of GPU resources, so higher parallelism on CPU-side is not always better. Look at the query execution plan below. Execution plan tree under the Gather is executable on background worker process. It scans t0 table which has 100million rows using four background worker processes and the coordinator process, in other words, 20million rows are handled per process by GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg, then its results are merged at Gather node. # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 GROUP by cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=955705.47..955720.93 rows=27 width=20) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=955705.47..955707.36 rows=756 width=44) Sort Key: t0.cat -> Gather (cost=955589.95..955669.33 rows=756 width=44) Workers Planned: 4 -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=954589.95..954593.73 rows=189 width=44) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on t0 (cost=27682.82..841218.52 rows=99996736 width=12) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Outer Scan: t0 (cost=0.00..1083384.84 rows=24999184 width=8) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 24999184...99996736) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.39MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (18 rows) Pullup underlying plans PG-Strom can run SCAN, JOIN and GROUP BY workloads on GPU, however, it does not work with best performance if these custom execution plan simply replace the standard operations at PostgreSQL. An example of problematic scenario is that SCAN once writes back its result data set to the host buffer then send the same data into GPU again to execute JOIN. Once again, JOIN results are written back and send to GPU to execute GROUP BY. It causes data ping-pong between CPU and GPU. To avoid such inefficient jobs, PG-Strom has a special mode which pulls up its sub-plan to execute a bunch of jobs in a single GPU kernel invocation. Combination of the operations blow can cause pull-up of sub-plans. SCAN + JOIN SCAN + GROUP BY SCAN + JOIN + GROUP BY The execution plan example below never pulls up the sub-plans. GpuJoin receives the result of GpuScan, then its results are passed to GpuPreAgg to generate the final results. # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 WHERE aid < bid GROUP BY cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=1239991.03..1239995.15 rows=27 width=20) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=1239991.03..1239991.50 rows=189 width=44) Sort Key: t0.cat -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=1239980.10..1239983.88 rows=189 width=44) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) (cost=50776.43..1199522.96 rows=33332245 width=12) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 33332245...33332245) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.39MB) -> Custom Scan (GpuScan) on t0 (cost=12634.49..1187710.85 rows=33332245 width=8) GPU Projection: cat, aid GPU Filter: (aid < bid) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (18 rows) This example causes data ping-pong between GPU and host buffers for each execution stage, so not efficient and less performance.

Brief overview PostgreSQL v10 newly support table partitioning. This mechanism splits one logically large table into physically small pieces. It is valuable because it can skip partitioned child tables which is obviously unnecessary to scan from the search qualification, and it can offer broader I/O bandwidth by physically distributed storage and so on. PostgreSQL v10 supports two kinds of them: range-partitioning and list-partitioning. Then, PostgreSQL v11 newly supports hash-partitioning and partition-wise JOINs. The diagram below shows a range-partitioning configuration with date -type key values. A record which has 2018-05-30 as key is distributed to the partition child table tbl_2018 , in the same way, a record which has 2014-03-21 is distributed to the partition child table tbl_2014 , and so on. In case when scan qualifier WHERE ymd > '2016-07-01'::date is added on scan of the partitioned table for example, it is obvious that tbl_2014 and tbl_2015 contains no records to match, therefore, PostgreSQL' optimizer constructs query execution plan which runs on only tbl_2016 , tbl_2017 and tbl_2018 then merges their results by Append node. It shall perform as if records are read from one logical table. When PG-Strom is used with table partitioning of PostgreSQL together, its optimizer may choose GpuScan to scan the individual partition child tables to be scanned, in the result of cost estimation. In this case, Append node merges the results of GpuScan . On the other hands, if query runs JOIN or GROUP BY, which can be accelerated by PG-Strom, next to the scan on partitioned table, it needs consideration from the standpoint of performance optimization. For example, in case when query scans non-partitioned table then runs JOIN with other tables and GROUP BY, under some conditions, it can handle step-step data exchange on GPU device memory. It is an optimal workload for PG-Strom due to minimized data exchange between GPU and CPU. In case when query runs corresponding workload on the partitioned table, it is problematic that Append node is injected into between the child tables scan and JOIN/GROUP BY. Under the query execution plan, the result of GpuScan must be written back to the host system, then Append merges them and send back the data to GPU to run the following GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg. It is never efficient query execution. The example below shows a query execution plan to the query which includes JOIN and GROUP BY towards the partitioned table pt by the key field ymd of date type; per year distribution. Due to the scan qualification, it omits scan on the partition child tables for 2016 or prior, in addition, a combined JOIN and GROUP BY on the pt_2017 , pt_2018 and pt_2019 shall be executed prior to the Append . # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM pt NATURAL JOIN t1 WHERE ymd > '2017-01-01'::date GROUP BY cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HashAggregate (cost=196410.07..196412.57 rows=200 width=48) Group Key: pt_2017.cat -> Gather (cost=66085.69..196389.07 rows=1200 width=72) Workers Planned: 2 -> Parallel Append (cost=65085.69..195269.07 rows=600 width=72) -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=65085.69..65089.69 rows=200 width=72) Reduction: Local Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on pt_2017 (cost=32296.64..74474.20 rows=1050772 width=40) Outer Scan: pt_2017 (cost=28540.80..66891.11 rows=1050772 width=36) Outer Scan Filter: (ymd > '2017-01-01'::date) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 1050772...2521854) HashKeys: pt_2017.aid JoinQuals: (pt_2017.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.78MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1935.00 rows=100000 width=12) -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=65078.35..65082.35 rows=200 width=72) Reduction: Local Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on pt_2018 (cost=32296.65..74465.75 rows=1050649 width=40) Outer Scan: pt_2018 (cost=28540.81..66883.43 rows=1050649 width=36) Outer Scan Filter: (ymd > '2017-01-01'::date) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 1050649...2521557) HashKeys: pt_2018.aid JoinQuals: (pt_2018.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.78MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1935.00 rows=100000 width=12) -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=65093.03..65097.03 rows=200 width=72) Reduction: Local Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on pt_2019 (cost=32296.65..74482.64 rows=1050896 width=40) Outer Scan: pt_2019 (cost=28540.80..66898.79 rows=1050896 width=36) Outer Scan Filter: (ymd > '2017-01-01'::date) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 1050896...2522151) HashKeys: pt_2019.aid JoinQuals: (pt_2019.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.78MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1935.00 rows=100000 width=12) (38 rows) Configuration and Operation By the GUC parameters below, PG-Strom enables/disables the push-down of JOIN/GROUP BY under the partition child tables.

Background The earlier version of PG-Strom had provided PL/CUDA for the cooperation between database and machine-learning / statistical-analytics. This feature allowed users to describe CUDA C code as user-defined SQL functions, to run computing intensive workloads on thousands cores of GPU. It sometimes run more than hundred times faster then CPU. On the other hands, it becomes general that people usually build their application on top of Python modules at machine-learning / statistical-analytics area, and little data scientist developed parallel programs using CUDA C. Since v2.3, PG-Strom allows to exchange contents of the database as a common data-frame that has compatible layout for machine-learning / statistical-analytics at Python. It extends software productivity by Python, with keeping the characteristics of PL/CUDA, which can utilize GPU's computing power without data exporting / importing, and a The features in this chapter basically focus on in-memory grade data size. Therefore, it should not be used to map terabytes data as a data-frame referable from Python. We assume a large scale raw log-data is once preprocessed with SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL, then supplied to machine-learning engine on Python over the common data-frames exchange, for example. Data exchange via cuPy cuPy is a module for matrix operations with numPy compatible APIs, which is widely accepted at Python environment, and runs these calculations on GPU. The matrix data referenced by cuPy locates on GPU device memory, and we can control them on the script as cupy.ndarray object. See the [official documentation] for the installation of cuPy and API referenced. PG-Strom allows to load contents of Arrow_Fdw foreign tables onto GPU device memory, and map this device memory region on the runtime environment of Python script. It enables smart data exchange without data exporting from the database. The SQL function pgstrom.arrow_fdw_export_cupy() of PG-Strom allocates a certain amount of GPU device memory, and loads the contents of Arrow_Fdw foreign table. This function takes a foreign table, set of attribute names, and optionally target GPU device-id as its arguments, then returns an unique identifier of the GPU buffer ( text ). On the Python script side, cupy_strom.ipc_import() can open the GPU buffer by the identifier, and returns cupy.ndarray object that is already setup on GPU device memory. Below is an example. PostgreSQL-side operations =# CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ft ( id int, x real, y real, z real ) SERVER arrow_fdw OPTIONS (file '/dev/shm/ftest.arrow', writable 'true'); =# INSERT INTO ft (SELECT x, pgstrom.random_int(0,1,10000)::float/100.0, pgstrom.random_int(0,1,10000)::float/100.0, pgstrom.random_int(0,1,10000)::float/100.0 FROM generate_series(1,5) x); =# SELECT * FROM ft; id | x | y | z ----+-------+-------+------- 1 | 51.61 | 73.23 | 7.53 2 | 49.73 | 29.75 | 37.31 3 | 61.15 | 55.15 | 36.07 4 | 23.76 | 40.76 | 51.74 5 | 61.43 | 86.87 | 47.64 (5 rows) Python-side operations import psycopg2 import cupy import cupy_strom conn = psycopg2.connect(\"host=localhost dbname=postgres\") curr = conn.cursor() curr.execute(\"select pgstrom.arrow_fdw_export_cupy('ft','{x,y,z}'::text[])\") row = curr.fetchone() X = cupy_strom.ipc_import(row[0]) print(X) conn.close() Results $ python ftest.py [[51.61 49.73 61.15 23.76 61.43] [73.23 29.75 55.15 40.76 86.87] [ 7.53 37.31 36.07 51.74 47.64]] The above example introduces Python script connects to PostgreSQL and calls pgstrom.arrow_fdw_export_cupy to create a GPU buffer that consists of column x , y and z of foreign table ft . Then, identifier returned from the function is passed to cupy_strom.ipc_import function, to build cupy.ndarray object accessible to Python script. Once cupy.ndarray object is built, you can control the GPU buffer using usual cuPy APIs. This example shows a small 5rows x 3columns matrix, however, here is no essential differences even if it is billion rows. As above, we can exchange data-frames between PostgreSQL and Python scripts. The GPU buffer allocated shall be released when session is closed. If you want to keep the GPU buffer after the session closed, use pgstrom.arrow_fdw_export_cupy_pinned instead for the buffer allocation. Please note that GPU device memory is preserved until invocation of pgstrom.arrow_fdw_unpin_gpu_buffer for explicit unpinning. Installation of cupy_strom The above cupy_strom can be installed using setup.py script, as follows: $ sudo pip3 install --upgrade numpy cupy cython $ git clone https://github.com/heterodb/pg-strom.git $ cd pg-strom/python $ python3 setup.py Execution of custom GPU kernel using cuPy cuPy has many APIs for matrix operations to pull out GPU's computing capability without CUDA C programming. On the other hands, it also allows execution of custom GPU kernel functions defined by users. Below is an example of custom GPU kernel definition using cupy.RawKernel for calculation of the average for each column of the input values ('X'). Construction of cupy.RawKernel object requires a source code of GPU kernel described in CUDA C and device function name of the entrypoint of GPU kernel. The CUDA C source code shall be compiled on the fly at the invocation of __call__ method, if no pre-built binary is at the cache. The arguments of __call__ method are size of grids, size of blocks and arguments of GPU kernel function from the head. This GPU kernel split the input values 'X' to sub-region for each 2048 items, and cooperates 1024 threads to calculate total sum in 11 steps. This task works for each block, then the output buffer Y eventually have total sum for each column. import psycopg2 import cupy import cupy_strom // connect to PostgreSQL, and get identifier of GPU buffer conn = psycopg2.connect(\"host=localhost dbname=postgres\") curr = conn.cursor() curr.execute(\"select pgstrom.arrow_fdw_export_cupy('ft','{x,y,z}'::text[])\") row = curr.fetchone() // import GPU buffer using the identifier string X = cupy_strom.ipc_import(row[0]) nattrs = X.shape[0] nitems = X.shape[1] gridSz = (nitems + 2047) >> 11; Y = cupy.zeros((nattrs)) // source code of the custom GPU kernel source=''' extern \"C\" __global__ __launch_bounds__(1024) void kern_gpu_sum(double *y, const float *x, int nitems) { __shared__ float lvalues[2048]; int gridSz = (nitems + 2047) / 2048; int colIdx = blockIdx.x / gridSz; int rowBase = (blockIdx.x % gridSz) * 2048; int localId = 2 * threadIdx.x; int i, k; // Load values to local shared buffer x += colIdx * nitems; for (i=threadIdx.x; i < 2048; i+=blockDim.x) lvalues[i] = (rowBase + i < nitems ? x[rowBase + i] : 0.0); __syncthreads(); // Run reduction operations for (k=0; k < 11; k++) { int mask = ((1 << k) - 1); if ((threadIdx.x & mask) == 0) lvalues[localId] += lvalues[localId + (1<<k)]; __syncthreads(); } // Write back the total sum if (threadIdx.x == 0) atomicAdd(&y[colIdx], lvalues[0]); } ''' kern = cupy.RawKernel(source, 'kern_gpu_sum') kern.__call__((gridSz * nattrs,1,1), (1024,1,1), (Y,X,nitems)) print(Y / nitems) conn.close() Results =# SELECT pgstrom.arrow_fdw_truncate('ft'); =# INSERT INTO ft (SELECT x, pgstrom.random_int(0,1,10000)::float/100.0, pgstrom.random_int(0,-7500,2500)::float/100.0, pgstrom.random_int(0,5000,15000)::float/100.0 FROM generate_series(1,1000000) x); =# SELECT avg(x), avg(y), avg(z) FROM ft; avg | avg | avg ------------------+-------------------+------------------ 50.0225953391276 | -24.9964806686448 | 100.037490822002 (1 row) $ python ftest.py [ 50.02259536 -24.99648063 100.03749086] Its test data intentionally slides the central of distribution for each column. The execution result, which exchanged the values to cuPy over the GPU buffer and calculated by the custom GPU kernel, fits in the result by SQL. Usage from PL/Python User Defined Functions PostgreSQL supports to implement user defined functions using Python language, using PL/Python package as a part of the core distribution. The LANGUAGE plpython3u option at CREATE FUNCTION statement enables Python language handle at the user defined function. Below is an example of PL/Python user defined function. We reuse the GPU kernel function that calculates the average value again. The arguments of PL/Python user defined functions are mapped to suitable Python data types by the handler. This example receives the identifier (text) of GPU buffer that is acquired by pgstrom.arrow_fdw_export_cupy , then it is mapped to cupy.ndarray for references on the Python-side. Here is no significant differences from the case when we run Python script on the shell. Only one difference is that we ensure cupy.ndarray object is released by X=0 , manually, after the execution of GPU kernel that stores total sum of X onto Y for each column.

On the other hands, it becomes general that people usually build their application on top of Python modules at machine-learning / statistical-analytics area, and little data scientist developed parallel programs using CUDA C. Since v2.3, PG-Strom allows to exchange contents of the database as a common data-frame that has compatible layout for machine-learning / statistical-analytics at Python. It extends software productivity by Python, with keeping the characteristics of PL/CUDA, which can utilize GPU's computing power without data exporting / importing, and a The features in this chapter basically focus on in-memory grade data size. Therefore, it should not be used to map terabytes data as a data-frame referable from Python.

The matrix data referenced by cuPy locates on GPU device memory, and we can control them on the script as cupy.ndarray object. See the [official documentation] for the installation of cuPy and API referenced. PG-Strom allows to load contents of Arrow_Fdw foreign tables onto GPU device memory, and map this device memory region on the runtime environment of Python script. It enables smart data exchange without data exporting from the database. The SQL function pgstrom.arrow_fdw_export_cupy() of PG-Strom allocates a certain amount of GPU device memory, and loads the contents of Arrow_Fdw foreign table. This function takes a foreign table, set of attribute names, and optionally target GPU device-id as its arguments, then returns an unique identifier of the GPU buffer ( text ). On the Python script side, cupy_strom.ipc_import() can open the GPU buffer by the identifier, and returns cupy.ndarray object that is already setup on GPU device memory. Below is an example.

Gstore_Fdw This feature is replaced by the writable Arrow_Fdw and its GPU export functionality. Largeobject export to/import from GPU According to the usecase analytics, we determined this feature is not needed. PG-Strom v2.2 Release PG-Strom Development Team (1-May-2019) Overview Major enhancement in PG-Strom v2.2 includes: Table partitioning support Columnar store support with Arrow_Fdw Pre-built GPU binary support Enables to implement GPU functions that returns variable length data GpuSort support on GPU memory store (Gstore_Fdw) NVME-oF support (Experimental) Prerequisites PostgreSQL v9.6, v10, v11 CUDA Toolkit 10.1 Linux distributions supported by CUDA Toolkit Intel x86 64bit architecture (x86_64) NVIDIA GPU CC 6.0 or later (Pascal or Volta) New Features Table partitioning support If multi-GPUs configuration, an optimal GPU shall be chosen according to the physical distance between GPU and child tables that construct a partition. If PG-Strom cannot identify the distance from PCIe-bus topology, like NVME-oF configuration, DBA can configure the relation of GPU and NVME-SSD using pg_strom.nvme_distance_map . When we join a partitioned table with non-partition tables, this version can produce a query execution plan that preliminary joins the non-partitioned table with partition child tables for each, and gather the results from child tables. This feature is proposed to PostgreSQL v13 core, as Asymmetric Partition-wise JOIN. Columnar store support with Arrow_Fdw It supports to read external Apache Arrow files using foreign table. It also supports SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL on Apache Arrow files. Pre-built GPU binary support When GPU binary code is generated from SQL, the older version wrote out eitire CUDA C source code, including static portions like libraries, then NVRTC(NVIDIA Run-Time Compiker) built them on the fly. However, a part of complicated function consumed much longer compilation time. v2.2 preliminary builds static functions preliminary, and only dynamic portion from SQL are built dynamically. It reduces the time for GPU binary generation. JSONB data type support This version allows to reference elements of JSONB object, and to utilize them as numeric or test . Enables to implement GPU functions that returns variable length data This version allows to implement SQL functions that returns variable-length data, like textcat , on GPU devices. GpuSort support on GPU memory store (Gstore_Fdw) This version allows to read data from GPU memory store for SQL workloads execution, not only PL/CUDA. Addition of regression test Several simple regression tests are added. NVME-oF support (Experimental) It supports SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL from remote SSD disks which are mounted using NVME-over-Fabric. Please note that it is an experimental feature, and it needs to replace the nvme_rdma kernel module on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x / CentOS 7.x. Features to be deprecated PostgreSQL v9.6 support CustomScan API in PostgreSQL v9.6 lacks a few APIs to handle dynamic shared memory (DSM), so it is unable to collect run-time statistics. It also changes the way to keep expression objects internally, therefore, we had to put #if ... #endif blocks at no little points. It has damaged to code maintainability. Due to the problems, this is the last version to support PostgreSQL v9.6. If you applied PG-Strom on PostgreSQL v9.6, let us recommend to move PostgreSQL v11 as soon as possible. The pgstrom format of Gstore_Fdw foreign table The internal data format on GPU memory store (Gstore_Fdw) is originally designed for data source of PL/CUDA procedures. It is our own format, and used PostgreSQL's data representations as is, like variable-length data, numeric, and so on. After that, NVIDIA released RAPIDS(cuDF), based on Apache Arrow, for data exchange on GPU, then its adoption becomes wider on machine-learning application and Python software stack. PG-Strom will switch its internal data format of Gstore_Fdw, to improve interoperability with these machine-learning software, then existing data format shall be deprecated. Dropped Features In-memory columnar cache As results of use-case analysis, we concluded Arrow_Fdw can replace this feature in most cases. Due to feature duplication, we dropped the in-memory columnar cache. PG-Strom v2.0 Release PG-Strom Development Team (17-Apr-2018) Overview Major enhancement in PG-Strom v2.0 includes: Overall redesign of the internal infrastructure to manage GPU and stabilization CPU+GPU hybrid parallel execution SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution In-memory columnar cache GPU memory store (gstore_fdw) Redesign of GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg and speed-up GpuPreAgg + GpuJoin + GpuScan combined GPU kernel You can download the summary of new features from: PG-Strom v2.0 Technical Brief . Prerequisites PostgreSQL v9.6, v10 CUDA Toolkit 9.1 Linux distributions supported by CUDA Toolkit Intel x86 64bit architecture (x86_64) NVIDIA GPU CC 6.0 or later (Pascal or Volta) New Features Entire re-design and stabilization of the internal infrastructure to manage GPU device. PostgreSQL backend process simultaneously uses only one GPU at most. In case of multi-GPUs installation, it assumes combination use with CPU parallel execution of PostgreSQL. Usually, it is not a matter because throughput of CPU to provide data to GPU is much narrower than capability of GPU processors. We prioritized simpleness of the software architecture. We began to utilize the demand paging feature of GPU device memory supported at the GPU models since Pascal generation. In most of SQL workloads, we cannot know exact size of the required result buffer prior to its execution, therefore, we had allocated more buffer than estimated buffer length, and retried piece of the workloads if estimated buffer size is not sufficient actually. This design restricts available resources of GPU which can be potentially used for other concurrent processes, and complicated error-retry logic was a nightmare for software quality. The demand paging feature allows to eliminate and simplify these stuffs. We stop to use CUDA asynchronous interface. Use of the demand paging feature on GPU device memory makes asynchronous APIs for DMA (like cuMemCpyHtoD ) perform synchronously, then it reduces concurrency and usage ratio of GPU kernels. Instead of the CUDA asynchronous APIs, PG-Strom manages its own worker threads which call synchronous APIs for each. As a by-product, we also could eliminate asynchronous callbacks ( cuStreamAddCallback ), it allows to use MPS daemon which has a restriction at this API. CPU+GPU Hybrid Parallel Execution CPU parallel execution at PostgreSQL v9.6 is newly supported. CustomScan logic of GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg provided by PG-Strom are executable on multiple background worker processes of PostgreSQL in parallel. Limitation: PG-Strom's own statistics displayed at EXPLAIN ANALYZE if CPU parallel execution. Because PostgreSQL v9.6 does not provide ShutdownCustomScan callback of the CustomScan interface, coordinator process has no way to reclaim information of worker processes prior to the release of DSM (Dynamic Shared Memory) segment. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution By cooperation with the nvme_strom Linux kernel module, it enables to load PostgreSQL's data blocks on NVMe-SSD to GPU device memory directly, bypassing the CPU and host buffer. This feature enables to apply PG-Strom on the area which have to process large data set more than system RAM size. It allows to pull out pretty high throughput close to the hardware limitation because its data stream skips block-device or filesystem layer. Then, GPU runs SQL workloads that usually reduce the amount of data to be processed by CPU. The chemical reaction of these characteristics enables to redefine GPU's role as accelerator of I/O workloads also, not only computing intensive workloads. In-memory Columnar Cache For middle size data-set loadable onto the system RAM, it allows to cache data-blocks in column format which is more suitable for GPU computing. If cached data-blocks are found during table scan, PG-Strom prefers to reference the columnar cache more than shared buffer of PostgreSQL. In-memory columnar cache can be built synchronously, or asynchronously by the background workers. You may remember very early revision of PG-Strom had similar feature. In case when a cached tuple gets updated, the latest in-memory columnar cache which we newly implemented in v2.0 invalidates the cache block which includes the updated tuples. It never updates the columnar cache according to the updates of row-store, so performance degradation is quite limited. GPU Memory Store (gstore_fdw) It enables to write to / read from preserved GPU device memory region by SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE in SQL-level, using foreign table interface. In v2.0, only pgstrom internal data format is supported. It saves written data using PG-Strom's buffer format of KDS_FORMAT_COLUMN . It can compress variable length data using LZ algorithm. In v2.0, GPU memory store can be used as data source of PL/CUDA user defined function. Redesign and performance improvement of GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg Stop using Dynamic Parallelism which we internally used in GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg, and revised entire logic of these operations. Old design had a problem of less GPU usage ratio because a GPU kernel which launches GPU sub-kernel and just waits for its completion occupied GPU's execution slot. A coproduct of this redesign is suspend/resume of GpuJoin. In principle, JOIN operation of SQL may generate larger number of rows than number of input rows, but preliminary not predictive. The new design allows to suspend GPU kernel once buffer available space gets lacked, then resume with new result buffer. It simplifies size estimation logic of the result buffer, and eliminates GPU kernel retry by lack of buffer on run-time. GpuPreAgg+GpuJoin+GpuScan combined GPU kernel In case when GPU executable SCAN, JOIN and GROUP BY are serially cascaded, a single GPU kernel invocation runs a series of tasks equivalent to the GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg. This is an approach to minimize data exchange between CPU and GPU. For example, result buffer of GpuJoin is used as input buffer of GpuPreAgg. This feature is especially valuable if combined with SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. PL/CUDA Enhancement #plcuda_include is enhanced to specify SQL function which returns text type. It can change the code block to inject according to the argument, so it also allows to generate multiple GPU kernel variations, not only inclusion of externally defined functions. If PL/CUDA takes reggstore type argument, GPU kernel function receives pointer of the GPU memory store. Note that it does not pass the OID value. Other Enhancement lo_import_gpu and lo_export_gpu functions allows to import contents of the GPU device memory acquired by external applications directly, or export contents of the largeobject to the GPU device memory. Packaging Add RPM packages to follow the PostgreSQL packages distributed by PostgreSQL Global Development Group. All the software packages are available at HeteroDB SWDC(Software Distribution Center) and downloadable. Document PG-Strom documentation was entirely rewritten using markdown and mkdocs. It makes documentation maintenance easier than the previous HTML based approach, so expects timely updates according to the development of new features. Test Regression test for PG-Strom was built on top of the regression test framework of PostgreSQL. Dropped features PostgreSQL v9.5 Support PostgreSQL v9.6 had big changes in both of the optimizer and executor to support CPU parallel query execution. The biggest change for extension modules that interact them is an enhancement of the interface called \"upper planner path-ification\". It allows to choose an optimal execution-plan from the multiple candidates based on the estimated cost, even if it is aggregation or sorting. It is fundamentally different from the older way where we rewrote query execution plan to inject GpuPreAgg using the hooks. It allows to inject GpuPreAgg node in more reasonable and reliable way, and we could drop complicated (and buggy) logic to rewrite query execution plan once constructed. CustomScan interface is also enhanced to support CPU parallel execution. Due to the reason, we dropped PostgreSQL v9.5 support to follow these new enhancement. GpuSort feature We dropped GpuSort because we have little advantages in the performance. Sorting is one of the GPU suitable workloads. However, in case when we try to sort data blocks larger than GPU device memory, we have to split the data blocks into multiple chunks, then partially sort them and merge them by CPU to generate final results. Larger chunk size is better to reduce the load to merge multiple chunks by CPU, on the other hands, larger chunk size takes larger lead time to launch GPU kernel to sort. It means here is a trade-off; which disallows asynchronous processing by PG-Strom to make data transfer latency invisible. It is hard to solve the problem, or too early to solve the problem, we dropped GpuSort feature once.","title":"Release Note"},{"location":"release_note/#pg-strom-v23-release","text":"PG-Strom Development Team (1-Apr-2020)","title":"PG-Strom v2.3 Release"},{"location":"release_note/#overview","text":"Major changes in PG-Strom v2.3 includes: - GpuJoin supports parallel construction of inner buffer - Arrow_Fdw now becomes writable; supports INSERT/TRUNCATE. - pg2arrow command supports 'append' mode. - mysql2arrow command was added.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"release_note/#prerequisites","text":"PostgreSQL v10, v11, v12 CUDA Toolkit 10.1 or later Linux distributions supported by CUDA Toolkit Intel x86 64bit architecture (x86_64) NVIDIA GPU CC 6.0 or later (Pascal or Volta)","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"release_note/#new-features","text":"GpuJoin supports parallel construction of inner buffer The older version construct inner buffer of GpuJoin by the backend process only.

PostgreSQL backend process simultaneously uses only one GPU at most. In case of multi-GPUs installation, it assumes combination use with CPU parallel execution of PostgreSQL. Usually, it is not a matter because throughput of CPU to provide data to GPU is much narrower than capability of GPU processors. We prioritized simpleness of the software architecture. We began to utilize the demand paging feature of GPU device memory supported at the GPU models since Pascal generation. In most of SQL workloads, we cannot know exact size of the required result buffer prior to its execution, therefore, we had allocated more buffer than estimated buffer length, and retried piece of the workloads if estimated buffer size is not sufficient actually. This design restricts available resources of GPU which can be potentially used for other concurrent processes, and complicated error-retry logic was a nightmare for software quality. The demand paging feature allows to eliminate and simplify these stuffs. We stop to use CUDA asynchronous interface. Use of the demand paging feature on GPU device memory makes asynchronous APIs for DMA (like cuMemCpyHtoD ) perform synchronously, then it reduces concurrency and usage ratio of GPU kernels. Instead of the CUDA asynchronous APIs, PG-Strom manages its own worker threads which call synchronous APIs for each. As a by-product, we also could eliminate asynchronous callbacks ( cuStreamAddCallback ), it allows to use MPS daemon which has a restriction at this API. CPU+GPU Hybrid Parallel Execution CPU parallel execution at PostgreSQL v9.6 is newly supported. CustomScan logic of GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg provided by PG-Strom are executable on multiple background worker processes of PostgreSQL in parallel. Limitation: PG-Strom's own statistics displayed at EXPLAIN ANALYZE if CPU parallel execution. Because PostgreSQL v9.6 does not provide ShutdownCustomScan callback of the CustomScan interface, coordinator process has no way to reclaim information of worker processes prior to the release of DSM (Dynamic Shared Memory) segment. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution By cooperation with the nvme_strom Linux kernel module, it enables to load PostgreSQL's data blocks on NVMe-SSD to GPU device memory directly, bypassing the CPU and host buffer. This feature enables to apply PG-Strom on the area which have to process large data set more than system RAM size. It allows to pull out pretty high throughput close to the hardware limitation because its data stream skips block-device or filesystem layer. Then, GPU runs SQL workloads that usually reduce the amount of data to be processed by CPU. The chemical reaction of these characteristics enables to redefine GPU's role as accelerator of I/O workloads also, not only computing intensive workloads. In-memory Columnar Cache For middle size data-set loadable onto the system RAM, it allows to cache data-blocks in column format which is more suitable for GPU computing. If cached data-blocks are found during table scan, PG-Strom prefers to reference the columnar cache more than shared buffer of PostgreSQL. In-memory columnar cache can be built synchronously, or asynchronously by the background workers. You may remember very early revision of PG-Strom had similar feature. In case when a cached tuple gets updated, the latest in-memory columnar cache which we newly implemented in v2.0 invalidates the cache block which includes the updated tuples. It never updates the columnar cache according to the updates of row-store, so performance degradation is quite limited. GPU Memory Store (gstore_fdw) It enables to write to / read from preserved GPU device memory region by SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE in SQL-level, using foreign table interface. In v2.0, only pgstrom internal data format is supported. It saves written data using PG-Strom's buffer format of KDS_FORMAT_COLUMN . It can compress variable length data using LZ algorithm. In v2.0, GPU memory store can be used as data source of PL/CUDA user defined function. Redesign and performance improvement of GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg Stop using Dynamic Parallelism which we internally used in GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg, and revised entire logic of these operations. Old design had a problem of less GPU usage ratio because a GPU kernel which launches GPU sub-kernel and just waits for its completion occupied GPU's execution slot. A coproduct of this redesign is suspend/resume of GpuJoin. In principle, JOIN operation of SQL may generate larger number of rows than number of input rows, but preliminary not predictive. The new design allows to suspend GPU kernel once buffer available space gets lacked, then resume with new result buffer. It simplifies size estimation logic of the result buffer, and eliminates GPU kernel retry by lack of buffer on run-time. GpuPreAgg+GpuJoin+GpuScan combined GPU kernel In case when GPU executable SCAN, JOIN and GROUP BY are serially cascaded, a single GPU kernel invocation runs a series of tasks equivalent to the GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg. This is an approach to minimize data exchange between CPU and GPU. For example, result buffer of GpuJoin is used as input buffer of GpuPreAgg. This feature is especially valuable if combined with SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. PL/CUDA Enhancement #plcuda_include is enhanced to specify SQL function which returns text type. It can change the code block to inject according to the argument, so it also allows to generate multiple GPU kernel variations, not only inclusion of externally defined functions. If PL/CUDA takes reggstore type argument, GPU kernel function receives pointer of the GPU memory store. Note that it does not pass the OID value. Other Enhancement lo_import_gpu and lo_export_gpu functions allows to import contents of the GPU device memory acquired by external applications directly, or export contents of the largeobject to the GPU device memory. Packaging Add RPM packages to follow the PostgreSQL packages distributed by PostgreSQL Global Development Group. All the software packages are available at HeteroDB SWDC(Software Distribution Center) and downloadable. Document PG-Strom documentation was entirely rewritten using markdown and mkdocs.

Test Regression test for PG-Strom was built on top of the regression test framework of PostgreSQL.","title":"New Features"},{"location":"release_note/#dropped-features_1","text":"PostgreSQL v9.5 Support PostgreSQL v9.6 had big changes in both of the optimizer and executor to support CPU parallel query execution. The biggest change for extension modules that interact them is an enhancement of the interface called \"upper planner path-ification\". It allows to choose an optimal execution-plan from the multiple candidates based on the estimated cost, even if it is aggregation or sorting. It is fundamentally different from the older way where we rewrote query execution plan to inject GpuPreAgg using the hooks. It allows to inject GpuPreAgg node in more reasonable and reliable way, and we could drop complicated (and buggy) logic to rewrite query execution plan once constructed. CustomScan interface is also enhanced to support CPU parallel execution. Due to the reason, we dropped PostgreSQL v9.5 support to follow these new enhancement. GpuSort feature We dropped GpuSort because we have little advantages in the performance. Sorting is one of the GPU suitable workloads. However, in case when we try to sort data blocks larger than GPU device memory, we have to split the data blocks into multiple chunks, then partially sort them and merge them by CPU to generate final results. Larger chunk size is better to reduce the load to merge multiple chunks by CPU, on the other hands, larger chunk size takes larger lead time to launch GPU kernel to sort. It means here is a trade-off; which disallows asynchronous processing by PG-Strom to make data transfer latency invisible. It is hard to solve the problem, or too early to solve the problem, we dropped GpuSort feature once.","title":"Dropped features"},{"location":"ssd2gpu/","text":"SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution Overview For the fast execution of SQL workloads, it needs to provide processors rapid data stream from storage or memory, in addition to processor's execution efficiency. Processor will run idle if data stream would not be delivered. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution directly connects NVMe-SSD which enables high-speed I/O processing by direct attach to the PCIe bus and GPU device that is also attached on the same PCIe bus, and runs SQL workloads very high speed by supplying data stream close to the wired speed of the hardware. Usually, PostgreSQL data blocks on the storage shall be once loaded to CPU/RAM through the PCIe bus, then, PostgreSQL runs WHERE-clause for filtering or JOIN/GROUP BY according to the query execution plan. Due to the characteristics of analytic workloads, the amount of result data set is much smaller than the source data set. For example, it is not rare case to read billions rows but output just hundreds rows after the aggregation operations with GROUP BY. In the other words, we consume bandwidth of the PCIe bus to move junk data, however, we cannot determine whether rows are necessary or not prior to the evaluation by SQL workloads on CPU. So, it is not avoidable restriction in usual implementation. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution changes the flow to read blocks from the storage sequentially. It directly loads data blocks to GPU using peer-to-peer DMA over PCIe bus, then runs SQL workloads on GPU device to reduce number of rows to be processed by CPU. In other words, it utilizes GPU as a pre-processor of SQL which locates in the middle of the storage and CPU/RAM for reduction of CPU's load, then tries to accelerate I/O processing in the results. This feature internally uses NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA. It allows peer-to-peer data transfer over PCIe bus between GPU device memory and third parth device by coordination using a custom Linux kernel module. So, this feature requires NVMe-Strom driver which is a Linux kernel module in addition to PG-Strom which is a PostgreSQL extension module. Also note that this feature supports only NVMe-SSD. It does not support SAS or SATA SSD. We have tested several NVMe-SSD models. You can refer 002: HW Validation List for your information. System Setup Driver Installation nvme_strom package is required to activate SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. This package contains a custom Linux kernel module which intermediates P2P DMA from NVME-SSD to GPU. You can obtain the package from the HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . If heterodb-swdc package is already installed, you can install the package by yum command. $ sudo yum install nvme_strom : ================================================================================ Package Arch Version Repository Size ================================================================================ Installing: nvme_strom x86_64 0.8-1.el7 heterodb 178 k Transaction Summary ================================================================================ Install 1 Package : DKMS: install completed.

The target table to be scanned locates on the partition being consist of NVMe-SSD. /dev/nvmeXXXX block device, or md-raid0 volume which consists of NVMe-SSDs only. The target table size is larger than pg_strom.nvme_strom_threshold . You can adjust this configuration. Its default is physical RAM size of the system plus 1/3 of shared_buffers configuration. Note Striped read from multiple NVMe-SSD using md-raid0 requires the enterprise subscription provided by HeteroDB,Inc. In order to deploy the tables on the partition consists of NVMe-SSD, you can use the tablespace function of PostgreSQL to specify particular tables or databases to place them on NVMe-SSD volume, in addition to construction of the entire database cluster on the NVMe-SSD volume. For example, you can create a new tablespace below, if NVMe-SSD is mounted at /opt/nvme . CREATE TABLESPACE my_nvme LOCATION '/opt/nvme'; In order to create a new table on the tablespace, specify the TABLESPACE option at the CREATE TABLE command below. CREATE TABLE my_table (...) TABLESPACE my_nvme; Or, use ALTER DATABASE command as follows, to change the default tablespace of the database. Note that tablespace of the existing tables are not changed in thie case. ALTER DATABASE my_database SET TABLESPACE my_nvme; Distance between GPU and NVME-SSD On selection of server hardware and installation of GPU and NVME-SSD, hardware configuration needs to pay attention to the distance between devices, to pull out maximum performance of the device. NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA , basis of the SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL mechanism, requires both of the edge devices of P2P DMA are connected on the same PCIe root complex. In the other words, unable to configure the P2P DMA traverses QPI between CPUs when NVME-SSD is attached on CPU1 and GPU is attached on CPU2 at dual socket system. From standpoint of the performance, it is recommended to use dedicated PCIe-switch to connect both of the devices more than the PCIe controller built in CPU. The photo below is a motherboard of HPC server. It has 8 of PCIe x16 slots, and each pair is linked to the other over the PCIe switch. The slots in the left-side of the photo are connected to CPU1, and right-side are connected to CPU2. When a table on SSD-2 is scanned using SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL, the optimal GPU choice is GPU-2, and it may be able to use GPU1. However, we have to avoid to choose GPU-3 and GPU-4 due to the restriction of GPUDirect RDMA. PG-Strom calculate logical distances on any pairs of GPU and NVME-SSD using PCIe bus topology information of the system on startup time. It is displayed at the start up log. Each NVME-SSD determines the preferable GPU based on the distance, for example, GPU1 shall be used on scan of the /dev/nvme2 . $ pg_ctl restart : LOG: GPU<->SSD Distance Matrix LOG: GPU0 GPU1 GPU2 LOG: nvme0 ( 3) 7 7 LOG: nvme5 7 7 ( 3) LOG: nvme4 7 7 ( 3) LOG: nvme2 7 ( 3) 7 LOG: nvme1 ( 3) 7 7 LOG: nvme3 7 ( 3) 7 : Usually automatic configuration works well. In case when NVME-over-Fabric(RDMA) is used, unable to identify the location of nvme device on the PCIe-bus, so you need to configure the logical distance between NVME-SSD and GPU manually. The example below shows the configuration of gpu2 for nvme1 , and gpu1 for nvme2 and nvme3 . It shall be added to postgresql.conf . Please note than manual configuration takes priority than the automatic configuration. pg_strom.nvme_distance_map = nvme1:gpu2, nvme2:gpu1, nvme3:gpu1 Operations Controls using GUC parameters There are two GPU parameters related to SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. The first is pg_strom.nvme_strom_enabled that simply turn on/off the function of SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. If off , SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution should not be used regardless of the table size or physical location. Default is on . The other one is pg_strom.nvme_strom_threshold which specifies the least table size to invoke SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. PG-Strom will choose SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution when target table is located on NVMe-SSD volume (or md-raid0 volume which consists of NVMe-SSD only), and the table size is larger than this parameter. Its default is sum of the physical memory size and 1/3 of the shared_buffers . It means default configuration invokes SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution only for the tables where we certainly cannot process them on memory. Even if SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution has advantages on a single table scan workload, usage of disk cache may work better on the second or later trial for the tables which are available to load onto the main memory. On course, this assumption is not always right depending on the workload charasteristics. Ensure usage of SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution EXPLAIN command allows to ensure whether SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution shall be used in the target query, or not. In the example below, a scan on the lineorder table by Custom Scan (GpuJoin) shows NVMe-Strom: enabled .

It also leads a problem. We cannot know which row is visible, or invisible at the time when PG-Strom requires P2P DMA for NVMe-SSD, because contents of the storage blocks are not yet loaded to CPU/RAM, and MVCC related attributes are written with individual records. PostgreSQL had similar problem when it supports IndexOnlyScan. To address the problem, PostgreSQL has an infrastructure of visibility map which is a bunch of flags to indicate whether any records in a particular data block are visible from all the transactions. If associated bit is set, we can know the associated block has no invisible records without reading the block itself. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution utilizes this infrastructure. It checks the visibility map first, then only \"all-visible\" blocks are required to read with SSD-to-GPU P2P DMA. VACUUM constructs visibility map, so you can enforce PostgreSQL to construct visibility map by explicit launch of VACUUM command.

It also leads a problem. We cannot know which row is visible, or invisible at the time when PG-Strom requires P2P DMA for NVMe-SSD, because contents of the storage blocks are not yet loaded to CPU/RAM, and MVCC related attributes are written with individual records. PostgreSQL had similar problem when it supports IndexOnlyScan. To address the problem, PostgreSQL has an infrastructure of visibility map which is a bunch of flags to indicate whether any records in a particular data block are visible from all the transactions. If associated bit is set, we can know the associated block has no invisible records without reading the block itself. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution utilizes this infrastructure. It checks the visibility map first, then only \"all-visible\" blocks are required to read with SSD-to-GPU P2P DMA.

Unfortunately, much smaller number of developer supports the PG-Strom development community than PostgreSQL developer's community, thus, due to the standpoint of software quality and history, it is a reasonable estimation to suspect PG-Strom first. The pg_strom.enabled parameter allows to turn on/off all the functionality of PG-Strom at once. The configuration below disables PG-Strom, thus identically performs with the standard PostgreSQL. # SET pg_strom.enabled = off; In addition, we provide parameters to disable particular execution plan like GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg. See references/GUC Parameters for more details. Collecting crash dump Crash dump is very helpful for analysis of serious problems which lead system crash for example. This session introduces the way to collect crash dump of the PostgreSQL and PG-Strom process (CPU side) and PG-Strom's GPU kernel, and show the back trace on the serious problems. Add configuration on PostgreSQL startup For generation of crash dump (CPU-side) on process crash, you need to change the resource limitation of the operating system for size of core file PostgreSQL server process can generate. For generation of crash dump (GPU-size) on errors of GPU kernel, PostgreSQL server process has CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION environment variable, and its value has 1 . You can put a configuration file at /etc/systemd/system/postgresql-<version>.service.d/ when PostgreSQL is kicked by systemd. In case of RPM installation, a configuration file pg_strom.conf is also installed on the directory, and contains the following initial configuration. [Service] LimitNOFILE=65536 LimitCORE=infinity #Environment=CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION=1 In CUDA 9.1, it usually takes more than several minutes to generate crash dump of GPU kernel, and it entirely stops response of the PostgreSQL session which causes an error. So, we recommend to set CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION environment variable only if you investigate errors of GPU kernels which happen on a certain query. The default configuration on RPM installation comments out the line of CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION environment variable. PostgreSQL server process should have unlimited Max core file size configuration, after the next restart.
