What is PG-Strom? PG-Strom is an extension module of PostgreSQL designed for version 11 or later. By utilization of GPU (Graphic Processor Unit) device which has thousands cores per chip, it enables to accelerate SQL workloads for data analytics or batch processing to big data set. Its core features are GPU code generator that automatically generates GPU program according to the SQL commands and asynchronous parallel execution engine to run SQL workloads on GPU device. The latest version supports SCAN (evaluation of WHERE-clause), JOIN and GROUP BY workloads. In the case when GPU-processing has advantage, PG-Strom replaces the vanilla implementation of PostgreSQL and transparentlly works from users and applications. PG-Strom has two storage options. The first one is the heap storage system of PostgreSQL. It is not always optimal for aggregation / analysis workloads because of its row data format, on the other hands, it has an advantage to run aggregation workloads without data transfer from the transactional database. The other one is Apache Arrow files, that have structured columnar format. Even though it is not suitable for update per row basis, it enables to import large amount of data efficiently, and efficiently search / aggregate the data through foreign data wrapper (FDW). One of the characteristic feature of PG-Strom is GPUDirect SQL that bypasses the CPU/RAM to read the data from NVME / NVME-oF to the GPU directly. SQL processing on the GPU maximizes the bandwidth of these devices. PG-Strom v3.0 newly supports NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage, it allows to support SDS (Software Defined Storage) over the NVME-oF protocol and shared filesystems. Also, the v3.0 newly supports execution of some PostGIS function and GiST index search on the GPU side. Along with the GPU cache, that duplicates the table contents often updated very frequently, it enables search / analysis processing based on the real-time locational information.

It collocates date of a row closely, so it works effectively for INSERT/UPDATE-major workloads, but not suitable for summarizing or analytics of mass-data. It is not usual to reference all the columns in a table on mass-data processing, and we tend to reference a part of columns in most cases. In this case, the storage I/O bandwidth consumed by unreferenced columns are waste, however, we have no easy way to fetch only particular columns referenced from the row-oriented data structure. In case of column oriented data structure, in an opposite manner, it has extreme disadvantage on INSERT/UPDATE-major workloads, however, it can pull out maximum performance of storage I/O on mass-data processing workloads because it can loads only referenced columns. From the standpoint of processor efficiency also, column-oriented data structure looks like a flat array that pulls out maximum bandwidth of memory subsystem for GPU, by special memory access pattern called Coalesced Memory Access. What is Apache Arrow? Apache Arrow is a data format of structured data to save in columnar-form and to exchange other applications. Some applications for big-data processing support the format, and it is easy for self-developed applications to use Apache Arrow format since they provides libraries for major programming languages like C,C++ or Python. Apache Arrow format file internally contains Schema portion to define data structure, and one or more RecordBatch to save columnar-data based on the schema definition. For data types, it supports integers, strint (variable-length), date/time types and so on. Indivisual columnar data has its internal representation according to the data types. Data representation in Apache Arrow is not identical with the representation in PostgreSQL. For example, epoch of timestamp in Arrow is 1970-01-01 and it supports multiple precision. In contrast, epoch of timestamp in PostgreSQL is 2001-01-01 and it has microseconds accuracy. Arrow_Fdw allows to read Apache Arrow files on PostgreSQL using foreign table mechanism. If an Arrow file contains 8 of record batches that has million items for each column data, for example, we can access 8 million rows on the Arrow files through the foreign table. Operations Creation of foreign tables Usually it takes the 3 steps below to create a foreign table. Define a foreign-data-wrapper using CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER command Define a foreign server using CREATE SERVER command Define a foreign table using CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command The first 2 steps above are included in the CREATE EXTENSION pg_strom command. All you need to run individually is CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command last. CREATE FOREIGN TABLE flogdata ( ts timestamp, sensor_id int, signal1 smallint, signal2 smallint, signal3 smallint, signal4 smallint, ) SERVER arrow_fdw OPTIONS (file '/path/to/logdata.arrow'); Data type of columns specified by the CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command must be matched to schema definition of the Arrow files to be mapped. Arrow_Fdw also supports a useful manner using IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA statement. It automatically generates a foreign table definition using schema definition of the Arrow files. It specifies the foreign table name, schema name to import, and path name of the Arrow files using OPTION-clause. Schema definition of Arrow files contains data types and optional column name for each column. It declares a new foreign table using these information. IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA flogdata FROM SERVER arrow_fdw INTO public OPTIONS (file '/path/to/logdata.arrow'); Foreign table options Arrow_Fdw supports the options below. Right now, all the options are for foreign tables. file=PATHNAME It maps an Arrow file specified on the foreign table. files=PATHNAME1[,PATHNAME2...] It maps multiple Arrow files specified by comma (,) separated files list on the foreign table. dir=DIRNAME It maps all the Arrow files in the directory specified on the foreign table. suffix=SUFFIX When dir option is given, it maps only files with the specified suffix, like .arrow` for example. parallel_workers=N_WORKERS It tells the number of workers that should be used to assist a parallel scan of this foreign table; equivalent to parallel_workers storage parameter at normal tables. writable=(true|false) It allows execution of INSERT command on the foreign table. See the section of \"Writable Arrow_Fdw\" Data type mapping Arrow data types are mapped on PostgreSQL data types as follows. Int mapped to either of int1 , int2 , int4 or int8 according to the bitWidth attribute. is_signed attribute shall be ignored. int1 is an enhanced data type by PG-Strom. FloatingPoint mapped to either of float2 , float4 or float8 according to the precision attribute. float2 is an enhanced data type by PG-Strom. Binary mapped to bytea data type Decimal mapped to numeric data type Date mapped to date data type; to be adjusted as if it has unit=Day precision. Time mapped to time data type; to be adjusted as if it has unit=MicroSecond precision. Timestamp mapped to timestamp data type; to be adjusted as if it has unit=MicroSecond precision. Interval mapped to interval data type. List mapped to 1-dimensional array of the element data type. Struct mapped to compatible composite data type; that shall be defined preliminary. FixedSizeBinary mapped to char(n) data type according to the byteWidth attribute. If pg_type=TYPENAME is configured, PG-Strom may assign the configured data type. Right now, inet and macaddr are supported. Union , Map , Duration , LargeBinary , LargeUtf8 , LargeList Right now, PG-Strom cannot map these Arrow data types onto any of PostgreSQL data types. How to read EXPLAIN EXPLAIN command show us information about Arrow files reading. The example below is an output of query execution plan that includes flineorder foreign table that mapps an Arrow file of 309GB. =# EXPLAIN SELECT sum(lo_extendedprice*lo_discount) as revenue FROM flineorder,date1 WHERE lo_orderdate = d_datekey AND d_year = 1993 AND lo_discount between 1 and 3 AND lo_quantity < 25; QUERY PLAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aggregate (cost=12632759.02..12632759.03 rows=1 width=32) -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=12632754.43..12632757.49 rows=204 width=8) Reduction: NoGroup Combined GpuJoin: enabled GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on flineorder (cost=9952.15..12638126.98 rows=572635 width=12) Outer Scan: flineorder (cost=9877.70..12649677.69 rows=4010017 width=16) Outer Scan Filter: ((lo_discount >= 1) AND (lo_discount <= 3) AND (lo_quantity < 25)) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 4010017...572635) HashKeys: flineorder.lo_orderdate JoinQuals: (flineorder.lo_orderdate = date1.d_datekey) KDS-Hash (size: 66.06KB) GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) NVMe-Strom: enabled referenced: lo_orderdate, lo_quantity, lo_extendedprice, lo_discount files0: /opt/nvme/lineorder_s401.arrow (size: 309.23GB) -> Seq Scan on date1 (cost=0.00..78.95 rows=365 width=4) Filter: (d_year = 1993) (18 rows) According to the EXPLAIN output, we can see Custom Scan (GpuJoin) scans flineorder foreign table. file0 item shows the filename ( /opt/nvme/lineorder_s401.arrow ) on behalf of the foreign table and its size. If multiple files are mapped, any files are individually shown, like file1 , file2 , ... The referenced item shows the list of referenced columns. We can see this query touches lo_orderdate , lo_quantity , lo_extendedprice and lo_discount columns. In addition, GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) and NVMe-Strom: enabled shows us the scan on flineorder uses SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL mechanism. VERBOSE option outputs more detailed information. =# EXPLAIN VERBOSE SELECT sum(lo_extendedprice*lo_discount) as revenue FROM flineorder,date1 WHERE lo_orderdate = d_datekey AND d_year = 1993 AND lo_discount between 1 and 3 AND lo_quantity < 25; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aggregate (cost=12632759.02..12632759.03 rows=1 width=32) Output: sum((pgstrom.psum((flineorder.lo_extendedprice * flineorder.lo_discount)))) -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=12632754.43..12632757.49 rows=204 width=8) Output: (pgstrom.psum((flineorder.lo_extendedprice * flineorder.lo_discount))) Reduction: NoGroup GPU Projection: flineorder.lo_extendedprice, flineorder.lo_discount, pgstrom.psum((flineorder.lo_extendedprice * flineorder.lo_discount)) Combined GpuJoin: enabled GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on public.flineorder (cost=9952.15..12638126.98 rows=572635 width=12) Output: flineorder.lo_extendedprice, flineorder.lo_discount GPU Projection: flineorder.lo_extendedprice::bigint, flineorder.lo_discount::integer Outer Scan: public.flineorder (cost=9877.70..12649677.69 rows=4010017 width=16) Outer Scan Filter: ((flineorder.lo_discount >= 1) AND (flineorder.lo_discount <= 3) AND (flineorder.lo_quantity < 25)) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 4010017...572635) HashKeys: flineorder.lo_orderdate JoinQuals: (flineorder.lo_orderdate = date1.d_datekey) KDS-Hash (size: 66.06KB) GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) NVMe-Strom: enabled referenced: lo_orderdate, lo_quantity, lo_extendedprice, lo_discount files0: /opt/nvme/lineorder_s401.arrow (size: 309.23GB) lo_orderpriority: 33.61GB lo_extendedprice: 17.93GB lo_ordertotalprice: 17.93GB lo_revenue: 17.93GB -> Seq Scan on public.date1 (cost=0.00..78.95 rows=365 width=4) Output: date1.d_datekey Filter: (date1.d_year = 1993) (28 rows) The verbose output additionally displays amount of column-data to be loaded on reference of columns. The load of lo_orderdate , lo_quantity , lo_extendedprice and lo_discount columns needs to read 87.4GB in total. It is 28.3% towards the filesize (309.2GB). How to make Arrow files This section introduces the way to transform dataset already stored in PostgreSQL database system into Apache Arrow file. Using PyArrow+Pandas A pair of PyArrow module, developed by Arrow developers community, and Pandas data frame can dump PostgreSQL database into an Arrow file. The example below reads all the data in table t0 , then write out them into /tmp/t0.arrow . import pyarrow as pa import pandas as pd X = pd.read_sql(sql=\"SELECT * FROM t0\", con=\"postgresql://localhost/postgres\") Y = pa.Table.from_pandas(X) f = pa.RecordBatchFileWriter('/tmp/t0.arrow', Y.schema) f.write_table(Y,1000000) # RecordBatch for each million rows f.close() Please note that the above operation once keeps query result of the SQL on memory, so should pay attention on memory consumption if you want to transfer massive rows at once. Using Pg2Arrow On the other hand, pg2arrow command, developed by PG-Strom Development Team, enables us to write out query result into Arrow file. This tool is designed to write out massive amount of data into storage device like NVME-SSD. It fetch query results from PostgreSQL database system, and write out Record Batches of Arrow format for each data size specified by the -s|--segment-size option. Thus, its memory consumption is relatively reasonable. pg2arrow command is distributed with PG-Strom. It shall be installed on the bin directory of PostgreSQL related utilities. $ ./pg2arrow --help Usage: pg2arrow [OPTION]... [DBNAME [USERNAME]] General options: -d, --dbname=DBNAME database name to connect to -c, --command=COMMAND SQL command to run -f, --file=FILENAME SQL command from file (-c and -f are exclusive, either of them must be specified) -o, --output=FILENAME result file in Apache Arrow format --append=FILENAME result file to be appended --output and --append are exclusive to use at the same time. If neither of them are specified, it creates a temporary file.) Arrow format options: -s, --segment-size=SIZE size of record batch for each (default: 256MB) Connection options: -h, --host=HOSTNAME database server host -p, --port=PORT database server port -U, --username=USERNAME database user name -w, --no-password never prompt for password -W, --password force password prompt Other options: --dump=FILENAME dump information of arrow file --progress shows progress of the job --set=NAME:VALUE GUC option to set before SQL execution Report bugs to <pgstrom@heterodbcom>. The -h or -U option specifies the connection parameters of PostgreSQL, like psql or pg_dump . The simplest usage of this command is running a SQL command specified by -c|--command option on PostgreSQL server, then write out results into the file specified by -o|--output option in Arrow format. --append option is available, instead of -o|--output option. It means appending data to existing Apache Arrow file. In this case, the target Apache Arrow file must have fully identical schema definition towards the specified SQL command. The example below reads all the data in table t0 , then write out them into the file /tmp/t0.arrow . $ pg2arrow -U kaigai -d postgres -c \"SELECT * FROM t0\" -o /tmp/t0.arrow Although it is an option for developers, --dump <filename> prints schema definition and record-batch location and size of Arrow file in human readable form. --progress option enables to show progress of the task. It is useful when a huge table is transformed to Apache Arrow format. Writable Arrow_Fdw Arrow_Fdw foreign tables that have writable option allow to append data using INSERT command, and to erase entire contents of the foreign table (that is Apache Arrow file on behalf of the foreign table) using pgstrom.arrow_fdw_truncate() function. On the other hand, UPDATE and DELETE commands are not supported. In case of writable option was enabled on Arrow_Fdw foreign tables, it accepts only one pathname specified by the file or files option. You cannot specify multiple pathnames, and exclusive to the dir option. It does not require that the Apache Arrow file actually exists on the specified path at the foreign table declaration time, on the other hands, PostgreSQL server needs to have permission to create a new file on the path. The diagram above introduces the internal layout of Apache Arrow files. In addition to the metadata like header or footer, it can have multiple DictionayBatch (dictionary data for dictionary compression) and RecordBatch (user data) chunks. RecordBatch is a unit of columnar data that have a particular number of rows. For example, on the Apache Arrow file that have x , y and z fields, when RecordBatch[0] contains 2,500 rows, it means 2,500 items of x , y and z fields are located at the RecordBatch[0] in columnar format. Also, when RecordBatch[1] contains 4,000 rows, it also means 4,000 items of x , y and z fields are located at the RecordBatch[1] in columnar format. Therefore, appending user data to Apache Arrow file is addition of a new RecordBatch. On Apache Arrow files, the file offset information towards DictionaryBatch and RecordBatch are internally held by the Footer chunk, which is next to the last RecordBatch. So, we can overwrite the original Footer chunk by the (k+1)th RecordBatch when INSERT command appends new data, then reconstruct a new Footer. Due to the data format, the newly appended RecordBatch has rows processed by the single INSERT command. So, it makes the file usage worst efficiency if an INSERT command added only a few rows. We recommend to insert as many rows as possible by a single INSERT command, when you add data to Arrow_Fdw foreign table. Write operations to Arrow_Fdw follows transaction control of PostgreSQL. No concurrent transactions can reference the rows newly appended until its commit, and user can rollback the pending written data, which is uncommited. Due to the implementation reason, writes to Arrow_Fdw foreign table acquires ShareRowExclusiveLock , although INSERT or UPDATE on regular PostgreSQL tables acquire RowExclusiveLock . It means only 1 transaction can write to a particular Arrow_Fdw foreign table concurrently. It is not a problem usually because the workloads Arrow_Fdw expects are mostly bulk data loading. When you design many concurrent transaction try to write Arrow_Fdw foreign table, we recomment to use a temporary table for many small writes. postgres=# CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ftest (x int) SERVER arrow_fdw OPTIONS (file '/dev/shm/ftest.arrow', writable 'true'); CREATE FOREIGN TABLE postgres=# INSERT INTO ftest (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,100)); INSERT 0 100 postgres=# BEGIN; BEGIN postgres=# INSERT INTO ftest (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,50)); INSERT 0 50 postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 150 (1 row) -- By the transaction rollback, the above INSERT shall be reverted. postgres=# ROLLBACK; ROLLBACK postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 100 (1 row) Right now, PostgreSQL does not support TRUNCATE statement on foreign tables. As an alternative, Arrow_Fdw provide pgstrom.arrow_fdw_truncate(regclass) function that eliminates all the contents of Apache Arrow file on behalf of the foreign table. postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 100 (1 row) postgres=# SELECT pgstrom.arrow_fdw_truncate('ftest'); arrow_fdw_truncate -------------------- (1 row) postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 0 (1 row) Advanced Usage SSDtoGPU Direct SQL In case when all the Arrow files mapped on the Arrow_Fdw foreign table satisfies the terms below, PG-Strom enables SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL to load columnar data. Arrow files are on NVME-SSD volume. NVME-SSD volume is managed by Ext4 filesystem. Total size of Arrow files exceeds the pg_strom.nvme_strom_threshold configuration. Partition configuration Arrow_Fdw foreign tables can be used as a part of partition leafs. Usual PostgreSQL tables can be mixtured with Arrow_Fdw foreign tables. So, pay attention Arrow_Fdw foreign table does not support any writer operations. And, make boundary condition of the partition consistent to the contents of the mapped Arrow file. It is a responsibility of the database administrators. A typical usage scenario is processing of long-standing accumulated log-data. Unlike transactional data, log-data is mostly write-once and will never be updated / deleted. Thus, by migration of the log-data after a lapse of certain period into Arrow_Fdw foreign table that is read-only but rapid processing, we can accelerate summarizing and analytics workloads. In addition, log-data likely have timestamp, so it is quite easy design to add partition leafs periodically, like monthly, weekly or others. The example below defines a partitioned table that mixes a normal PostgreSQL table and Arrow_Fdw foreign tables.

Apache Arrow format file internally contains Schema portion to define data structure, and one or more RecordBatch to save columnar-data based on the schema definition. For data types, it supports integers, strint (variable-length), date/time types and so on. Indivisual columnar data has its internal representation according to the data types. Data representation in Apache Arrow is not identical with the representation in PostgreSQL. For example, epoch of timestamp in Arrow is 1970-01-01 and it supports multiple precision. In contrast, epoch of timestamp in PostgreSQL is 2001-01-01 and it has microseconds accuracy. Arrow_Fdw allows to read Apache Arrow files on PostgreSQL using foreign table mechanism.

On the other hand, UPDATE and DELETE commands are not supported. In case of writable option was enabled on Arrow_Fdw foreign tables, it accepts only one pathname specified by the file or files option. You cannot specify multiple pathnames, and exclusive to the dir option. It does not require that the Apache Arrow file actually exists on the specified path at the foreign table declaration time, on the other hands, PostgreSQL server needs to have permission to create a new file on the path. The diagram above introduces the internal layout of Apache Arrow files. In addition to the metadata like header or footer, it can have multiple DictionayBatch (dictionary data for dictionary compression) and RecordBatch (user data) chunks. RecordBatch is a unit of columnar data that have a particular number of rows. For example, on the Apache Arrow file that have x , y and z fields, when RecordBatch[0] contains 2,500 rows, it means 2,500 items of x , y and z fields are located at the RecordBatch[0] in columnar format. Also, when RecordBatch[1] contains 4,000 rows, it also means 4,000 items of x , y and z fields are located at the RecordBatch[1] in columnar format. Therefore, appending user data to Apache Arrow file is addition of a new RecordBatch. On Apache Arrow files, the file offset information towards DictionaryBatch and RecordBatch are internally held by the Footer chunk, which is next to the last RecordBatch. So, we can overwrite the original Footer chunk by the (k+1)th RecordBatch when INSERT command appends new data, then reconstruct a new Footer. Due to the data format, the newly appended RecordBatch has rows processed by the single INSERT command. So, it makes the file usage worst efficiency if an INSERT command added only a few rows. We recommend to insert as many rows as possible by a single INSERT command, when you add data to Arrow_Fdw foreign table. Write operations to Arrow_Fdw follows transaction control of PostgreSQL. No concurrent transactions can reference the rows newly appended until its commit, and user can rollback the pending written data, which is uncommited. Due to the implementation reason, writes to Arrow_Fdw foreign table acquires ShareRowExclusiveLock , although INSERT or UPDATE on regular PostgreSQL tables acquire RowExclusiveLock . It means only 1 transaction can write to a particular Arrow_Fdw foreign table concurrently. It is not a problem usually because the workloads Arrow_Fdw expects are mostly bulk data loading. When you design many concurrent transaction try to write Arrow_Fdw foreign table, we recomment to use a temporary table for many small writes. postgres=# CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ftest (x int) SERVER arrow_fdw OPTIONS (file '/dev/shm/ftest.arrow', writable 'true'); CREATE FOREIGN TABLE postgres=# INSERT INTO ftest (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,100)); INSERT 0 100 postgres=# BEGIN; BEGIN postgres=# INSERT INTO ftest (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,50)); INSERT 0 50 postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 150 (1 row) -- By the transaction rollback, the above INSERT shall be reverted. postgres=# ROLLBACK; ROLLBACK postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM ftest; count ------- 100 (1 row) Right now, PostgreSQL does not support TRUNCATE statement on foreign tables.

Overview In the technological domain known as IoT/M2M, various software has been developed to store and analyze the large amount of log data generated by devices such as cell phones, automobiles, and various sensors, as well as PCs and servers. This is because the data generated by a large number of devices from time-by-time tend to grow up huge, and special architecture/technology is required to process it in a practical amount of time. PG-Strom's features are designed and implemented for high-speed processing of log data of such a scale. On the other hand, it tends to be a time-consuming job to transfer and import these data into a database in order to make it searchable/summarizable on such a scale. Therefore, PG-Strom includes a fluent-plugin-arrow-file module for Fluentd that outputs the data in Apache Arrow format, and tries to deal with the problem. Fluentd is a log collection tool developed by Sadayuki Furuhashi. It is the de facto standard for collecting and storing a wide variety of log data, ranging from server logs like Syslog to device logs of IoT/M2M devices. Fluentd allows customization of the input/output and processing of log data by adding plugins written in Ruby. As of 2022, more than 800 plugins have been introduced on the official website. PG-Strom can handle two types of data formats: PostgreSQL Heap format (transactional row data) and Apache Arrow format (structured column data). The Apache Arrow format is suitable for workloads like those in the IoT/M2M, where huge amounts of data are generated time-by-time. arrow-file plugin This chapter describes the approach to write out the log data collected by Fluentd in Apache Arrow format, and to refere it with PG-Strom. We assume td-agent here, that is a stable version of Fluentd provided by Treasure Data. PG-Strom includes the fluent-plugin-arrow-file module. This allows Fluentd to write out the log data it collects as an Apache Arrow format file with a specified schema structure. Using PG-Strom's Arrow_Fdw, this Apache Arrow format file can be accessed as an foreign table. In addition, GPU-Direct SQL allows to load these files extremely fast, if the storage system is appropriately configured. This has the following advantages: There is no need to import data into the DB because PG-Strom directly accesses the files output by Fluentd. The data readout (I/O load) for the searching and summarizing process can be kept to a minimum because of the columnar data format. You can archive outdated log data only by moving files on the OS. On the other hand, in cases that it takes a long time to store a certain size of log (for example, log generation is rare), another method such as outputting to a PostgreSQL table is suitable for more real-time log analysis. This is because the size of the Record Batch needs to be reasonably large to acquire the performance benefits of the Apache Arrow format. Internals There are several types of plugins for Fluentd: Input plugins to receive logs from outside, Parser plugins to shape the logs, Buffer plugins to temporarily store the received logs, and Output plugins to output the logs. The arrow-file plugin is categorized as Output plugin. It writes out a \"chunk\" of log data passed from the Buffer plugin in Apache Arrow format with the schema structure specified in the configuration. The Input/Parser plugin is responsible for converting the received logs into a common format so that the Buffer and Output plugins can handle the input data without being aware of its format. The common format is a pair of tag , an identifier that can be used to sort the logs, a log timestamp time , and record , an associative array formed from the raw logs. The arrow-file plugin writes to an Apache Arrow format file with the tag and time fields and each element of the record associative array as a column (some may be omitted). Therefore, the output destination file name and schema definition information (mapping of associative array elements to columns/types) are mandatory configuration parameters. Installation Install the td-agent package for Linux distribution you are using. The rake-compiler module is required to install the arrow-file plugin, so please install it before. $ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent4.sh | sh $ sudo /opt/td-agent/bin/fluent-gem install rake-compiler Next, download the source code for PG-Strom and build arrow-file plugin in the fluentd directory. $ git clone https://github.com/heterodb/pg-strom.git $ cd pg-strom/fluentd $ make TD_AGENT=1 gem $ sudo make TD_AGENT=1 install To confirm that the Fluentd plugin is installed, run the following command. $ /opt/td-agent/bin/fluent-gem list | grep arrow fluent-plugin-arrow-file (0.2) Configuration As mentioned above, the arrow-file plugin requires the output path of the file and the schema definition at least. In addition to this, in order to acquire the best performance for searching and aggregation processing, the single chunk of data inside the Apache Arrow file, called the Record Batch, needs to be reasonably large in size. The arrow-file plugin creates a Record Batch for each chunk passed from the Buffer plugin. Therefore, the buffer size of the Buffer plugin should be set with the size of the Record Batch in mind. By the default, the Buffer plugin is set to take a buffer size of 256MB. The configuration parameters for the arrow-file plugin are as follows: path [type: String ] (Required) Specify the file path of the destination. This is a required parameter, and you can use placeholders shown below. Placeholders Description %Y The current year expressed as a four-digit number. %y The current year expressed as a number in the last two digits of the year. %m A two-digit number representing the current month, 01-12. %d A two-digit number representing the current day from 01 to 31. %H A two-digit number representing the hour of the current time 00-23. %M A two-digit number representing the minute of the current time, 00-59. %S A two-digit number representing the second of the current time, 00-59. %p The PID of the current Fluentd process. The placeholder is replaced when the chunk is written out. If an Apache Arrow format file of the same name exists, the Record Batch will be appended to it. If it does not exist, a new Apache Arrow format file is created and the first Record Batch is written out. However, if the size of the existing Apache Arrow file exceeds the filesize_threshold setting described below, rename the existing file and then create a new one. (Example) path /tmp/arrow_logs/my_logs_%y%m%d.%p.log The output Apache Arrow file updates the footer area to point to all Record Batches each time a chunk is written out. Therefore, the generated Apache Arrow file can be read immediately. However, to avoid access conflicts, exclusive handling is required using lockf(3) . schema_defs [type: String ] (Required) Specify the schema definition of the Apache Arrow format file output by fluent-plugin-arrow-file . This is a required parameter, and define the schema structure using strings in the following format. schema_defs := column_def1[,column_def2 ...] column_def := <column_name>=<column_type>[;<column_attrs>] <column_name> is the name of the column, which must match the key value of the associative array passed from Fluentd to arrow-file plugin. <column_type> is the data type of the column. See the following table. <column_attrs> is an additional attribute for columns. At this time, only the following attributes are supported. stat_enabled ... The statistics for the configured columns will be collected and the maximum/minimum values for each Record Batch will be set as custom metadata in the form of max_values=... and min_values=... . (Example) schema_defs \"ts=Timestamp;stat_enabled,dev_id=Uint32,temperature=Float32,humidity=Float32\" Data types supported by the arrow-file plugin Data types Description Int8 Int16 Int32 Int64 Signed integer with the specified bit width. Uint8 Uint16 Uint32 Uint64 Unsigned integer with the specified bit width Float16 Float32 Float64 Floating point number with half-precision(16bit), single-precision(32bit) and double-precision(64bit). Decimal Decimal128 128-bit fixed decimal; 256-bit fixed decimal is currently not supported. Timestamp Timestamp[sec] Timestamp[ms] Timestamp[us] Timestamp[ns] Timestamp type with the specified precision. If the precision is omitted, it is treated the same as [us] . Time Time[sec] Time[ms] Time[us] Time[ns] Time type with the specified precision. If the precision is omitted, it is treated the same as [sec] . Date Date[Day] Date[ms] Date type with the specified precision. If the precision is omitted, it is treated the same as [day] . Utf8 String type. Ipaddr4 IP address(IPv4) type. This is represented as a FixedSizeBinary type with byteWidth=4 and custom metadata pg_type=pg_catalog.inet . Ipaddr6 IP address(IPv6) type. This is represented as a FixedSizeBinary type with byteWidth=16 and custom metadata pg_type=pg_catalog.inet . ts_column [type: String / default: unspecified] Specify a column name to set the timestamp value of the log passed from Fluentd (not from record ). This parameter is usually a date-time type such as Timestamp , and the stat_enabled attribute should also be specified to achieve fast search. tag_column [type: String / default: unspecified] Specify a column name to set the tag value of the log passed from Fluentd (not from record ). This parameter is usually a string type such as utf8 . filesize_threshold [type: Integer / default: 10000] Specify the threshold for switching the output destination file in MB. By default, the output destination is switched when the file size exceeds about 10GB. Example As a simple example, this chapter shows a configuration for monitoring the log of a local Apache Httpd server, parsing it field by field, and writing it to an Apache Arrow format file. By setting <source> , /var/log/httpd/access_log will be the data source. Then, the apache2 Parse plugin will cut out the fields: host, user, time, method, path, code, size, referer, agent. The fields are then passed to the arrow-file plugin as an associative array. In schema_defs in <match> , the column definitions of the Apache Arrow file corresponding to the fields are set.

This is because the data generated by a large number of devices from time-by-time tend to grow up huge, and special architecture/technology is required to process it in a practical amount of time. PG-Strom's features are designed and implemented for high-speed processing of log data of such a scale. On the other hand, it tends to be a time-consuming job to transfer and import these data into a database in order to make it searchable/summarizable on such a scale. Therefore, PG-Strom includes a fluent-plugin-arrow-file module for Fluentd that outputs the data in Apache Arrow format, and tries to deal with the problem. Fluentd is a log collection tool developed by Sadayuki Furuhashi. It is the de facto standard for collecting and storing a wide variety of log data, ranging from server logs like Syslog to device logs of IoT/M2M devices. Fluentd allows customization of the input/output and processing of log data by adding plugins written in Ruby. As of 2022, more than 800 plugins have been introduced on the official website. PG-Strom can handle two types of data formats: PostgreSQL Heap format (transactional row data) and Apache Arrow format (structured column data). The Apache Arrow format is suitable for workloads like those in the IoT/M2M, where huge amounts of data are generated time-by-time.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"fluentd/#arrow-file-plugin","text":"This chapter describes the approach to write out the log data collected by Fluentd in Apache Arrow format, and to refere it with PG-Strom. We assume td-agent here, that is a stable version of Fluentd provided by Treasure Data. PG-Strom includes the fluent-plugin-arrow-file module. This allows Fluentd to write out the log data it collects as an Apache Arrow format file with a specified schema structure. Using PG-Strom's Arrow_Fdw, this Apache Arrow format file can be accessed as an foreign table. In addition, GPU-Direct SQL allows to load these files extremely fast, if the storage system is appropriately configured. This has the following advantages: There is no need to import data into the DB because PG-Strom directly accesses the files output by Fluentd. The data readout (I/O load) for the searching and summarizing process can be kept to a minimum because of the columnar data format. You can archive outdated log data only by moving files on the OS. On the other hand, in cases that it takes a long time to store a certain size of log (for example, log generation is rare), another method such as outputting to a PostgreSQL table is suitable for more real-time log analysis.

The Input/Parser plugin is responsible for converting the received logs into a common format so that the Buffer and Output plugins can handle the input data without being aware of its format. The common format is a pair of tag , an identifier that can be used to sort the logs, a log timestamp time , and record , an associative array formed from the raw logs. The arrow-file plugin writes to an Apache Arrow format file with the tag and time fields and each element of the record associative array as a column (some may be omitted).

In addition to this, in order to acquire the best performance for searching and aggregation processing, the single chunk of data inside the Apache Arrow file, called the Record Batch, needs to be reasonably large in size. The arrow-file plugin creates a Record Batch for each chunk passed from the Buffer plugin. Therefore, the buffer size of the Buffer plugin should be set with the size of the Record Batch in mind. By the default, the Buffer plugin is set to take a buffer size of 256MB. The configuration parameters for the arrow-file plugin are as follows: path [type: String ] (Required) Specify the file path of the destination. This is a required parameter, and you can use placeholders shown below. Placeholders Description %Y The current year expressed as a four-digit number. %y The current year expressed as a number in the last two digits of the year. %m A two-digit number representing the current month, 01-12. %d A two-digit number representing the current day from 01 to 31. %H A two-digit number representing the hour of the current time 00-23. %M A two-digit number representing the minute of the current time, 00-59. %S A two-digit number representing the second of the current time, 00-59. %p The PID of the current Fluentd process. The placeholder is replaced when the chunk is written out. If an Apache Arrow format file of the same name exists, the Record Batch will be appended to it. If it does not exist, a new Apache Arrow format file is created and the first Record Batch is written out. However, if the size of the existing Apache Arrow file exceeds the filesize_threshold setting described below, rename the existing file and then create a new one. (Example) path /tmp/arrow_logs/my_logs_%y%m%d.%p.log The output Apache Arrow file updates the footer area to point to all Record Batches each time a chunk is written out. Therefore, the generated Apache Arrow file can be read immediately. However, to avoid access conflicts, exclusive handling is required using lockf(3) . schema_defs [type: String ] (Required) Specify the schema definition of the Apache Arrow format file output by fluent-plugin-arrow-file . This is a required parameter, and define the schema structure using strings in the following format. schema_defs := column_def1[,column_def2 ...] column_def := <column_name>=<column_type>[;<column_attrs>] <column_name> is the name of the column, which must match the key value of the associative array passed from Fluentd to arrow-file plugin. <column_type> is the data type of the column.

The same is true when PG-Strom processes SQL queries on the GPU. Internally, the records read from the PostgreSQL table are transferred to the GPU, and then various SQL operations are executed on the GPU. However, these processes take time to read the tables and transfer the data. (In many cases, much longer than the processing on the GPU!) GPU Cache is a function that reserves an area on the GPU device memory in advance and keeps a copy of the PostgreSQL table there. This can be used to execute search/analysis SQL in real time for data that is relatively small(~10GB) and is frequently updated. The log-based synchronization mechanism described below allows GPU Cache to be kept up-to-date without interfering with highly parallel and transactional workloads. Nevertheless, you can process search/analytical SQL workloads on data already loaded on GPU Cache without reading the records from the table again or transferring the data over the PCI-E bus. A typical use case of GPU Cache is to join location data, such as the current position of a mobile device like a car or a cell phone, collected in real time with other data using GPU-PostGIS . The workload of updating location information sent out by many devices is extremely heavy. However, it also needs to be applied on the GPU side without delay in order to perform search/analysis queries based on the latest location information. Although the size is limited, GPU Cache is one option to achieve both high frequency updates and high-performance search/analysis query execution. Architecture GPU Caches needs to satisfy two requirements: highly parallel update-based workloads and search/analytical queries on constantly up-to-date data. In many systems, the CPU and GPU are connected via the PCI-E bus, and there is a reasonable delay in their communication. Therefore, synchronizing GPU Cache every time a row is updated in the target table will significantly degrade the transaction performance. Using GPU Cache allocates a \"REDO Log Buffer\" on the shared memory on the host side in addition to the area on the memory of the GPU. When a SQL command (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is executed to update a table, the updated contents are copied to the REDO Log Buffer by the AFTER ROW trigger. Since this process can be completed by CPU and RAM alone without any GPU call, it has little impact on transaction performance. When a certain amount of unapplied REDO Log Entries accumulate in the REDO Log Buffer, or a certain amount of time has passed since the last write, it is loaded by a background worker process (GPU memory keeper) and applied to GPU Cache. At this time, REDO Log Entries are transferred to the GPU in batches and processed in parallel by thousands of processor cores on the GPU, so delays caused by this process are rarely a problem. Search/analysis queries against the target table in GPU Cache do not load the table data, but use the data mapped from GPU Cache pre-allocated on the GPU device memory. If there are any unapplied REDO Logs at the start of the search/analysis query, they will all be applied to GPU Cache. This means that the results of a search/analysis query scanning the target GPU Cache will return the same results as if it were referring to the table directly, and the query will always be consistent. Configuration To enable GPU Cache, configure a trigger that executes pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger() function on AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE for each row. If GPU Cache is used on the replication slave, the invocation mode of this trigger must be ALWAYS . Below is an example to configure GPU Cache on the dpoints table. =# create trigger row_sync after insert or update or delete on dpoints_even for row execute function pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger(); =# alter table dpoints_even enable always trigger row_sync; Note Additional configuration at PostgreSQL v12 or prior. In case when GPU Cache is used at PostgreSQL v12 or prior, you need to configure an additional BEFORE TRUNCATE statement trigger that executes pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger() function. If you want to use the GPU Cache on the replication slave, If you use GPU Cache at the PostgreSQL v12 or prior, in a similar way, invocation mode of this trigger must have ALWAYS . PostgreSQL v13 enhanced its object-access-hook mechanism, so allows extension modules to capture execution of TRUNCATE without triggers configuration. On the other hand, the prior version still needs the BEFORE TRUNCATE statement trigger to keep consistency of GPU Cache by capture of TRUNCATE. Below is an example to configure GPU Cache on the dpoints table at PostgreSQL v12 or prior. =# create trigger row_sync after insert or update or delete on dpoints_even for row execute function pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger(); =# create trigger stmt_sync before truncate on dpoints_even for statement execute function pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger(); =# alter table dpoints_even enable always trigger row_sync; =# alter table dpoints_even enable always trigger stmt_sync; GPU Cache Customize You can customize GPU Cache by specifying an optional string in the form of KEY=VALUE as an argument to GPU Cache line trigger. Please note that where you should specify is not to the syntax trigger. The following SQL statement is an example of creating a GPU Cache whose maximum row count is 2.5 million rows and the size of the REDO Log Buffer is 100MB. =# create trigger row_sync after insert or update or delete on dpoints_even for row execute function pgstrom.gpucache_sync_trigger('max_num_rows=2500000,redo_buffer_size=100m'); The options that can be given to the argument of the line trigger are shown below. gpu_device_id=GPU_ID (default: 0) Specify the target GPU device ID to allocate GPU Cache. max_num_rows=NROWS (default: 10485760) Specify the number of rows that can be allocated on GPU Cache. Just as with PostgreSQL tables, GPU Cache needs to retain updated rows prior to commit for visibility control, so max_num_rows should be specified with some margin. Note that the old version of the updated/deleted row will be released after the transaction is committed. redo_buffer_size=SIZE (default: 160m) Specify the size of REDO Log Buffer. You can use k, m and g as the unit. gpu_sync_interval=SECONDS (default: 5) If the specified time has passed since the last write to the REDO Log Buffer, REDO Log will be applied to the GPU, regardless of the number of rows updated. gpu_sync_threshold=SIZE (default: 25% of redo_buffer_size ) When the unapplied REDO Log in the REDO Log Buffer reaches SIZE bytes, it is applied to the GPU side. You can use k, m and g as the unit. GPU Cache Options Below are GPU Cache related PostgreSQL configuration parameters. pg_strom.enable_gpucache (default: on) This option controls whether search/analytical queries will use GPU Cache or not. If this value is off, the data will be read from the table each time, ignoring GPU Cache even if it is available. Note that this setting has no effect on REDO Log Buffer appending by triggers. pg_strom.gpucache_auto_preload (default: NULL) When PostgreSQL is started/restarted, GPU Cache for the table specified by this parameter will be built in advance. The value should be in the format: DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME . To specify multiple tables, separate them by commas. If GPU Cache is not built, the PostgreSQL backend process that first attempts to access GPU Cache will scan the entire target table and transfer it to the GPU. This process usually takes a considerable amount of time. However, by specifying the tables that should be loaded in this option, you can avoid waiting too long the first time you run a search/analysis query. If this parameter is set to '*', it will attempt to load the contents of all tables with GPU Cache into the GPU in order. At this time, the background worker will access all the databases in order, and will return exit code 1 to prompt the postmaster to restart. The server startup log will show that the \"GPUCache Startup Preloader\" exited with exit code 1 as follows, but this is not abnormal. LOG: database system is ready to accept connections LOG: background worker \"GPUCache Startup Preloader\" (PID 856418) exited with exit code 1 LOG: background worker \"GPUCache Startup Preloader\" (PID 856427) exited with exit code 1 LOG: create GpuCacheSharedState dpoints:164c95f71 LOG: gpucache: AllocMemory dpoints:164c95f71 (main_sz=772505600, extra_sz=0) LOG: gpucache: auto preload 'public.dpoints' (DB: postgres) LOG: create GpuCacheSharedState mytest:1773a589b LOG: gpucache: auto preload 'public.mytest' (DB: postgres) LOG: gpucache: AllocMemory mytest:1773a589b (main_sz=675028992, extra_sz=0) Operations Confirm GPU Cache usage GPU Cache is referred to transparently. The user does not need to be aware of the presence or absence of GPU Cache, and PG-Strom will automatically determine and switch the process. The following is the query plan for a query that refers to the table \"dpoints\" which has GPU Cache set. The 3rd row from the bottom, in the \"GPU Cache\" field, shows the basic information about GPU Cache of this table. We can see that the query is executed with referring to GPU Cache and not the \"dpoints\" table. Note that the meaning of each item is as follows: max_num_rows indicates the maximum number of rows that GPU Cache can hold; main indicates the size of the area in GPU Cache for fixed-length fields; extra indicates the size of the area for variable-length data. =# explain select pref, city, count(*) from giscity g, dpoints d where pref = 'Tokyo' and st_contains(g.geom,st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) group by pref, city; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HashAggregate (cost=5638809.75..5638859.99 rows=5024 width=29) Group Key: g.pref, g.city -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=5638696.71..5638759.51 rows=5024 width=29) Reduction: Local Combined GpuJoin: enabled GPU Preference: GPU0 (NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on dpoints d (cost=631923.57..5606933.23 rows=50821573 width=21) Outer Scan: dpoints d (cost=0.00..141628.18 rows=7999618 width=16) Depth 1: GpuGiSTJoin(nrows 7999618...50821573) HeapSize: 3251.36KB IndexFilter: (g.geom ~ st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) on giscity_geom_idx JoinQuals: st_contains(g.geom, st_makepoint(d.x, d.y)) GPU Preference: GPU0 (NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) GPU Cache: NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB [max_num_rows: 12000000, main: 772.51M, extra: 0] -> Seq Scan on giscity g (cost=0.00..8929.24 rows=6353 width=1883) Filter: ((pref)::text = 'Tokyo'::text) (16 rows) Check status of GPU Cache Use the pgstrom.gpucache_info view to check the current state of GPU Cache. =# select * from pgstrom.gpucache_info ; database_oid | database_name | table_oid | table_name | signature | refcnt | corrupted | gpu_main_sz | gpu_extra_sz | redo_write_ts | redo_write_nitems | redo_write_pos | redo_read_nitems | redo_read_pos | redo_sync_pos | config_options --------------+---------------+-----------+------------+------------+--------+-----------+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+-------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 12728 | postgres | 25244 | mytest | 6295279771 | 3 | f | 675028992 | 0 | 2021-05-14 03:00:18.623503 | 500000 | 36000000 | 500000 | 36000000 | 36000000 | gpu_device_id=0,max_num_rows=10485760,redo_buffer_size=167772160,gpu_sync_interval=5000000,gpu_sync_threshold=41943040 12728 | postgres | 25262 | dpoints | 5985886065 | 3 | f | 772505600 | 0 | 2021-05-14 03:00:18.524627 | 8000000 | 576000192 | 8000000 | 576000192 | 576000192 | gpu_device_id=0,max_num_rows=12000000,redo_buffer_size=167772160,gpu_sync_interval=5000000,gpu_sync_threshold=41943040 (2 rows) Note that pgstrom.gpucache_info will only show the status of GPU Caches that have been initially loaded and have space allocated on the GPU device memory at that time.

This is used internally to avoid a situation where many sessions generate asynchronous requests at the same time when the remaining REDO Log Buffer is running out. config_options The optional string to customize GPU Cache. GPU Cache corruption and recovery If and when REDO logs could not be applied on the GPU cache by some reasons, like insertion of more rows than the max_num_rows configuration, or too much consumption of variable-length data buffer, GPU cache moves to the \"corrupted\" state. Once GPU cache gets corrupted, search/analysis SQL does not reference the GPU cache, and table updates stops writing REDO log. (If GPU cache gets corrupted after beginning of a search/analysis SQL unfortunately, this query may raise an error.) The pgstrom.gpucache_recovery(regclass) function recovers the GPU cache from the corrupted state. If you run this function after removal of the cause where REDO logs could not be applied, it runs initial-loading of the GPU cache again, then tries to recover the GPU cache. For example, if GPU cache gets corrupted because you tried to insert more rows than the max_num_rows , you reconfigure the trigger with expanded max_num_rows configuration or you delete a part of rows from the table, then runs pgstrom.gpucache_recovery() function.","title":"GPU Cache"},{"location":"gpucache/#gpu-cache","text":"","title":"GPU Cache"},{"location":"gpucache/#overview","text":"GPU has a device memory that is independent of the RAM in the host system, and in order to calculate on the GPU, data must be transferred from the host system or storage device to the GPU device memory once through the PCI-E bus. The same is true when PG-Strom processes SQL queries on the GPU. Internally, the records read from the PostgreSQL table are transferred to the GPU, and then various SQL operations are executed on the GPU. However, these processes take time to read the tables and transfer the data. (In many cases, much longer than the processing on the GPU!) GPU Cache is a function that reserves an area on the GPU device memory in advance and keeps a copy of the PostgreSQL table there. This can be used to execute search/analysis SQL in real time for data that is relatively small(~10GB) and is frequently updated. The log-based synchronization mechanism described below allows GPU Cache to be kept up-to-date without interfering with highly parallel and transactional workloads. Nevertheless, you can process search/analytical SQL workloads on data already loaded on GPU Cache without reading the records from the table again or transferring the data over the PCI-E bus. A typical use case of GPU Cache is to join location data, such as the current position of a mobile device like a car or a cell phone, collected in real time with other data using GPU-PostGIS . The workload of updating location information sent out by many devices is extremely heavy. However, it also needs to be applied on the GPU side without delay in order to perform search/analysis queries based on the latest location information.

In many systems, the CPU and GPU are connected via the PCI-E bus, and there is a reasonable delay in their communication. Therefore, synchronizing GPU Cache every time a row is updated in the target table will significantly degrade the transaction performance. Using GPU Cache allocates a \"REDO Log Buffer\" on the shared memory on the host side in addition to the area on the memory of the GPU. When a SQL command (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is executed to update a table, the updated contents are copied to the REDO Log Buffer by the AFTER ROW trigger. Since this process can be completed by CPU and RAM alone without any GPU call, it has little impact on transaction performance. When a certain amount of unapplied REDO Log Entries accumulate in the REDO Log Buffer, or a certain amount of time has passed since the last write, it is loaded by a background worker process (GPU memory keeper) and applied to GPU Cache. At this time, REDO Log Entries are transferred to the GPU in batches and processed in parallel by thousands of processor cores on the GPU, so delays caused by this process are rarely a problem. Search/analysis queries against the target table in GPU Cache do not load the table data, but use the data mapped from GPU Cache pre-allocated on the GPU device memory. If there are any unapplied REDO Logs at the start of the search/analysis query, they will all be applied to GPU Cache.

However, there is a nasty dilemma between key-value deduplication and parallel / distributed processing, including GPU utilization. There are two strategies to implement key-value deduplication. The first one is pre-sorting of the input data stream to the Aggregate operation that actually runs COUNT(distinct) . It increments the internal counter each time the key-value changes. It is a simple implementation, however, sorting a large amount of data is a heavy process, and this method strongly depends on the order in which records are processed, so there is no choice but to execute it in a single thread. One other idea is building an internal hash-table of Aggregate operation to track all the key-values for deduplication. It is not easy to predict amount of memory consumption in advance, and can often consume too much resources. These characteristics prevents to run COUNT (distinct KEY) aggregate function on GPUs in parallel, thus, PG-Strom does not support right now. Overview For example, when we use the number of unique users aggregated by COUNT (distinct KEY) as a source of graph, in other words, in a usage scene where a certain amount of error is sufficiently acceptable, we may be able to subsitute a mathematically predicted estimation with a certain level of accuracy, instead of the strict deduplication and aggregation. HyperLogLog is an algorithm to estimate the number of unique key-values from a large data set. Due to its characteristics, it is easy to easy to partition large-scale table scans by multiple processes, and the memory consumption is sufficiently small and predictable in advance, so suitable for GPU processing. Below introduces the basic idea of HyperLogLog. First, the key-values for the deduplication shall be applied to the hash function to calculate the hash value. If the hash function performs good enough, we can assume the hash value bit patterns corresponding to the key-values are randomly distributed. Then, among the hash-values devived from many kind of key-values, we expect there is a characteristics one in which 0-bits appear consecutively. For example, in the case of a data set with 32 different key values, it is no wonder if there is 4 consecutive bits pattern from the latest bit, such as ... 1011000 , in any of the hash-values generated from the key-values. In this way, HyperLogLog estimates the cardinality of the original dataset by examining the maximum number of consecutive 0-bits from the leatest bits of the hash-values. In practice, some bits of the hash value are used as \"register selectors\". For example, if 8 bits are used as a selector, 256 registers shall be reserved for HLL Sketch in advance, and the register on HLL Scketch is indexed by the least 8 bits of the hash value. Then, the number of consecutive 0-bits from the least significant bit of the remaining hash values is counter, and the maximum value shall be recorded for each register. What recorded in the register is the number of 0-bits from the least bits, therefore, in case of the 64-bit hash function, used in PG-Strom, 8-bits registers are sufficient to record the necessary information. If the nummber of registers is 256, the total required storage area is only 256bytes. Usage By using the aggregate function the hll_count(KEY) provided by PG-Strom instead of the count (distinct KEY) , it allows to estimate the cardinality using HyperLogLog. For example, the strict deduplication of the lo_custkey column in the following query has a cardinality of 2,000,000, but it took more than 400 seconds to derive this result from the lineorder table with 600 million rows (87GB). increase. Its query execution plan by EXPLAIN displays that it does not choose CPU parallel query, thus it scans the entire table in a single process. =# select count(distinct lo_custkey) from lineorder ; count --------- 2000000 (1 row) Time: 403360.908 ms (06:43.361) =# explain select count(distinct lo_custkey) from lineorder ; QUERY PLAN ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aggregate (cost=18896094.80..18896094.81 rows=1 width=8) -> Seq Scan on lineorder (cost=0.00..17396057.84 rows=600014784 width=6) (2 rows) On the other hand, use of the hll_count(lo_custkey) instead of the count (distinct lo_custkey) allows to get relatively accurate cardinality estimate of 2,005,437 (0.3% error rate to the actual value) on the same hardware, but 40 times faster than the strict deduplication. Its query execution plan by EXPLAIN displays that it utilizes various acceleration technologies, in addition to CPU parallel query, such as GPU aggregation and GPU-Direct SQL. =# select hll_count(lo_custkey) from lineorder ; hll_count ----------- 2005437 (1 row) Time: 9660.810 ms (00:09.661) =# explain select hll_count(lo_custkey) from lineorder ; QUERY PLAN ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aggregate (cost=4992387.95..4992387.96 rows=1 width=8) -> Gather (cost=4992387.72..4992387.93 rows=2 width=32) Workers Planned: 2 -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) on lineorder (cost=4991387.72..4991387.73 rows=1 width=32) Reduction: NoGroup Outer Scan: lineorder (cost=2833.33..4913260.79 rows=250006160 width=6) GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) GPUDirect SQL: enabled (8 rows) Cautions Due to the characteristics of the HyperLogLog algorithm, the estimation error is not negligible for attributes with small key-value cardinality. For example, the lo_orderpriority column of the lineorder table below can have only 5 different values from '1-URGENT' to '5-LOW' . The count (distinct lo_order priority) tells us that its strict deduplicated cardinarity was 5. On the other hand, hll_count (lo_orderpriority) tells us the estimated cardinarity was 370. When using hll_count() , we need to pay attention for the characteristics and distribution of the data. =# select count(distinct lo_orderpriority) from lineorder ; count ------- 5 (1 row) =# select hll_count(lo_orderpriority) from lineorder ; hll_count ----------- 370 (1 row) Re-use of HLL Scketch Check query execution plan again, when the aggregate function hll_count() is executed. We can confirm the output list for each execution step, by explain verbose . =# explain verbose select hll_count(lo_custkey) from lineorder ; QUERY PLAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aggregate (cost=4992387.95..4992387.96 rows=1 width=8) Output: hll_merge((pgstrom.hll_sketch_new(pgstrom.hll_hash(lo_custkey)))) -> Gather (cost=4992387.72..4992387.93 rows=2 width=32) Output: (pgstrom.hll_sketch_new(pgstrom.hll_hash(lo_custkey))) Workers Planned: 2 -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) on public.lineorder (cost=4991387.72..4991387.73 rows=1 width=32) Output: (pgstrom.hll_sketch_new(pgstrom.hll_hash(lo_custkey))) GPU Output: (pgstrom.hll_sketch_new(pgstrom.hll_hash(lo_custkey))) GPU Setup: pgstrom.hll_hash(lo_custkey) Reduction: NoGroup Outer Scan: public.lineorder (cost=2833.33..4913260.79 rows=250006160 width=6) GPU Preference: GPU0 (Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) GPUDirect SQL: enabled Kernel Source: /var/lib/pgdata/pgsql_tmp/pgsql_tmp_strom_374786.6.gpu Kernel Binary: /var/lib/pgdata/pgsql_tmp/pgsql_tmp_strom_374786.7.ptx (15 rows) It shows us the Aggregate node runs hll_merge() instead of the hll_count() . This is an aggregate function that receives bytea datum of HLL Sketch and outputs a cardinality estimate. It is the role of GpuPreAgg to generate the HLL Sketch, where the hash value generated by pgstrom.hll_hash() is passed to pgstrom.hll_sketch_new() to create a HLL Sketch of the lo_custkey column. Note that the HLL Sketch generated here already completes partial aggregation, thus, only 1 row with HLL Sketch shall be poped for each worker process, where its internal state has been already updated according to the contents of 200 million rows. In other words, it pre-processes the aggregation of 200 million records on the GPU into 1 HLL Sketch, then CPU finally merges the HLL Sketches and generates the estimation. Due to the characteristics of the algorithm, for example, if HLL Sketch is calculated in advance for each monthly data and saved in the database, the difference can be obtained without scanning the entire table to estimate the cardinality of key values. You can get the cardinarity estimation by calculating the HLL Sketch towards the differences and merging it with the saved HLL Sketches. For example, the following query calculates HLL Sketch on annual basis and estimates the cumulative cardinality by merging the annual HLL Sketch. This data is artificially adjusted to increase the cardinality of lo_custkey . You can see the estimated total number of customers has increased year by year. =# select lo_orderdate / 10000 as year, hll_sketch(lo_custkey) as sketch into pg_temp.annual from lineorder group by 1; SELECT 7 =# select year, hll_sketch_histogram(sketch) from pg_temp.annual order by year; year | hll_sketch_histogram ------+------------------------------------------------------- 1992 | {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,73,132,118,82,39,26,12,2,4,2} 1993 | {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,59,118,125,96,50,30,15,2,6,2} 1994 | {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,33,111,133,113,53,36,17,4,6,2} 1995 | {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,21,99,131,121,62,42,18,5,7,3,1} 1996 | {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,17,84,119,131,73,50,20,5,7,4,1} 1997 | {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,71,118,128,82,53,23,10,7,4,2} 1998 | {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13,64,114,126,86,61,23,11,8,4,2} (7 rows) =# select max_y, (select hll_merge(sketch) from pg_temp.annual where year < max_y) from generate_series(1993,1999) max_y; max_y | hll_merge -------+----------- 1993 | 854093 1994 | 1052429 1995 | 1299916 1996 | 1514915 1997 | 1700274 1998 | 1889527 1999 | 2005437 (7 rows) Note that hll_sketch_histogram() is a SQL function which receives a raw data of HLL Sketch, then returns its histogram of the distribution of register values.","title":"HyperLogLog"},{"location":"hll_count/#countdistinct-with-hyperloglog","text":"","title":"COUNT(distinct) with HyperLogLog"},{"location":"hll_count/#background","text":"We often run the SELECT COUNT (distinct KEY) command on large datasets to count the number of unique users or items (this is called cardinality). However, there is a nasty dilemma between key-value deduplication and parallel / distributed processing, including GPU utilization. There are two strategies to implement key-value deduplication. The first one is pre-sorting of the input data stream to the Aggregate operation that actually runs COUNT(distinct) . It increments the internal counter each time the key-value changes. It is a simple implementation, however, sorting a large amount of data is a heavy process, and this method strongly depends on the order in which records are processed, so there is no choice but to execute it in a single thread. One other idea is building an internal hash-table of Aggregate operation to track all the key-values for deduplication. It is not easy to predict amount of memory consumption in advance, and can often consume too much resources. These characteristics prevents to run COUNT (distinct KEY) aggregate function on GPUs in parallel, thus, PG-Strom does not support right now.","title":"Background"},{"location":"hll_count/#overview","text":"For example, when we use the number of unique users aggregated by COUNT (distinct KEY) as a source of graph, in other words, in a usage scene where a certain amount of error is sufficiently acceptable, we may be able to subsitute a mathematically predicted estimation with a certain level of accuracy, instead of the strict deduplication and aggregation. HyperLogLog is an algorithm to estimate the number of unique key-values from a large data set. Due to its characteristics, it is easy to easy to partition large-scale table scans by multiple processes, and the memory consumption is sufficiently small and predictable in advance, so suitable for GPU processing. Below introduces the basic idea of HyperLogLog. First, the key-values for the deduplication shall be applied to the hash function to calculate the hash value. If the hash function performs good enough, we can assume the hash value bit patterns corresponding to the key-values are randomly distributed. Then, among the hash-values devived from many kind of key-values, we expect there is a characteristics one in which 0-bits appear consecutively. For example, in the case of a data set with 32 different key values, it is no wonder if there is 4 consecutive bits pattern from the latest bit, such as ... 1011000 , in any of the hash-values generated from the key-values. In this way, HyperLogLog estimates the cardinality of the original dataset by examining the maximum number of consecutive 0-bits from the leatest bits of the hash-values. In practice, some bits of the hash value are used as \"register selectors\". For example, if 8 bits are used as a selector, 256 registers shall be reserved for HLL Sketch in advance, and the register on HLL Scketch is indexed by the least 8 bits of the hash value. Then, the number of consecutive 0-bits from the least significant bit of the remaining hash values is counter, and the maximum value shall be recorded for each register. What recorded in the register is the number of 0-bits from the least bits, therefore, in case of the 64-bit hash function, used in PG-Strom, 8-bits registers are sufficient to record the necessary information.

GPU Direct SQL Execution needs NVME-SSD devices, or fast network card with RoCE support, and to be installed under the same PCIe Root Complex where GPU is located on. GPU Device PG-Strom requires at least one GPU device on the system, which is supported by CUDA Toolkit, has computing capability 6.0 (Pascal generation) or later; Please check at 002: HW Validation List - List of supported GPU models for GPU selection. Operating System PG-Strom requires Linux operating system for x86_64 architecture, and its distribution supported by CUDA Toolkit. Our recommendation is Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS version 8.x series. GPU Direct SQL Execution (w/ HeteroDB driver) needs Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS version 7.3/8.0 or newer. GPU Direct SQL Execution (w/ NVIDIA driver; experimental) needs Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS version 8.3 or newer, and Mellanox OFED (OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution) driver. PostgreSQL PG-Strom v3.0 requires PostgreSQL v11 or later. Some of PostgreSQL APIs used by PG-Strom internally are not included in the former versions. CUDA Toolkit PG-Strom requires CUDA Toolkit version 11.4 or later. Some of CUDA Driver APIs used by PG-Strom internally are not included in the former versions. NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage (GDS) has been included in the CUDA Toolkit version 11.4 or later. Selection of GPU Direct SQL Execiton drivers Please consider the software stack for GPUDirect SQL, prior to the installation. There are two individual Linux kernel driver for GPUDirect SQL execution, as follows: HeteroDB NVME-Strom The dedicated Linux kernel module, released at 2018, supported since PG-Strom v2.0. It supports RHEL7.x/RHEL8.x, enables direct read from local NVME-SSDs to GPU using GPUDirect RDMA. NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage The general purpose driver stack, has been developed by NVIDIA, to support direct read from NVME/NVME-oF devices to GPU. At May-2021, its public beta revision has been published. PG-Strom v3.0 experimentally supports the GPUDirect Storage, that supports RHEL8.3/8.4 and Ubuntu 18.04/20.04. Some partners, including HeteroDB, expressed to support this feature. It also allows direct read from shared-filesystems or SDS(Software Defined Storage) devices over NVME-oF protocols. Here is little performance differences on the above two drivers. On the other hands, GPUDirect Storage has more variations of the supported storages and filesystems, and more mature software QA process, expect for the case of PG-Strom on RHEL7/CentOS7, we will recommend to use GPUDirect Storage driver. Tips For RHEL8/CentOS8 or Ubuntu 18.04/20.04, install the software according to the following steps. OS Installation CUDA Toolkit Installation heterodb-extra module installation No need to install heterodb-kmod MOFED Driver installation GPUDirect Storage module installation PostgreSQL installation PG-Strom installation PostGIS installation (on the demand) For RHEL7/CentOS7, install the software according to the following steps. OS Installation CUDA Toolkit Installation heterodb-extra module installation heterodb-kmod module installation No need to install MOFED Driver and GPUDirect Storage module PostgreSQL installation PG-Strom installation PostGIS installation (on the demand) OS Installation Choose a Linux distribution which is supported by CUDA Toolkit, then install the system according to the installation process of the distribution. NVIDIA DEVELOPER ZONE introduces the list of Linux distributions which are supported by CUDA Toolkit. In case of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x or CentOS 8.x series, choose \"Minimal installation\" as base environment, and also check the following add-ons. Development Tools Next to the OS installation on the server, go on the package repository configuration to install the third-party packages. If you didn't check the \"Development Tools\" at the installer, we can additionally install the software using the command below after the operating system installation. # dnf groupinstall 'Development Tools' Tip If GPU devices installed on the server are too new, it may cause system crash during system boot. In this case, you may avoid the problem by adding nouveau.modeset=0 onto the kernel boot option, to disable the inbox graphic driver. Disables nouveau driver When the nouveau driver, that is an open source compatible driver for NVIDIA GPUs, is loaded, it prevent to load the nvidia driver. In this case, reboot the operating system after a configuration to disable the nouveau driver. To disable the nouveau driver, put the following configuration onto /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nouveau.conf , and run dracut command to apply them on the boot image of Linux kernel. Then, restart the system once. # cat > /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nouveau.conf <<EOF blacklist nouveau options nouveau modeset=0 EOF # dracut -f # shutdown -r now epel-release Installation Several software modules required by PG-Strom are distributed as a part of EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux). You need to add a repository definition of EPEL packages for yum system to obtain these software. One of the package we will get from EPEL repository is DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support). It is a framework to build Linux kernel module for the running Linux kernel on demand; used for NVIDIA's GPU driver and related. Linux kernel module must be rebuilt according to version-up of Linux kernel, so we don't recommend to operate the system without DKMS. epel-release package provides the repository definition of EPEL. You can obtain the package from the Fedora Project website. For CentOS8, it can be installed using dnf command. -- For RHEL8 # dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm -- For CentOS8 # dnf install epel-release heterodb-swdc Installation PG-Strom and related packages are distributed from HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . You need to add a repository definition of HeteroDB-SWDC for you system to obtain these software. heterodb-swdc package provides the repository definition of HeteroDB-SWDC. Access to the HeteroDB Software Distribution Center using Web browser, download the heterodb-swdc-1.2-1.el8.noarch.rpm on top of the file list, then install this package. Once heterodb-swdc package gets installed, yum system configuration is updated to get software from the HeteroDB-SWDC repository. Install the heterodb-swdc package as follows. # dnf install https://heterodb.github.io/swdc/yum/rhel8-noarch/heterodb-swdc-1.2-1.el8.noarch.rpm CUDA Toolkit Installation This section introduces the installation of CUDA Toolkit. If you already installed the latest CUDA Toolkit, you can skip this section. NVIDIA offers two approach to install CUDA Toolkit; one is by self-extracting archive (called runfile), and the other is by RPM packages. We recommend RPM installation because it allows simple software updates. You can download the installation package for CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA DEVELOPER ZONE. Choose your OS, architecture, distribution and version, then choose \"rpm(network)\" edition. Once you choose the \"rpm(network)\" option, it shows a few step-by-step commands to configure the repository definition and to install the related packages, by RPM installation of CUDA Toolkit over the network. The example below is the commands for RHEL8/CentOS8. sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/rhel8/x86_64/cuda-rhel8.repo sudo dnf clean all sudo dnf -y module install nvidia-driver:latest-dkms sudo dnf -y install cuda Once installation completed successfully, CUDA Toolkit is deployed at /usr/local/cuda . $ ls /usr/local/cuda bin include libnsight nvml samples tools doc jre libnvvp nvvm share version.txt extras lib64 nsightee_plugins pkgconfig src Once installation gets completed, ensure the system recognizes the GPU devices correctly. nvidia-smi command shows GPU information installed on your system, as follows. $ nvidia-smi Thu May 27 15:05:50 2021 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 465.19.01 Driver Version: 465.19.01 CUDA Version: 11.3 | |-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M| Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Note Here is an extra explanation for fast_ssd_mode parameter. When NVME-Strom Linux kernel module get a request for GPUDirect SQL data transfer, first of all, it checks whether the required data blocks are caches on page-caches of operating system. If fast_ssd_mode is 0 , NVME-Strom once writes back page caches of the required data blocks to the userspace buffer of the caller, then indicates application to invoke normal host-->device data transfer by CUDA API. It is suitable for non-fast NVME-SSDs such as PCIe x4 grade. On the other hands, GPUDirect data transfer may be faster, if you use PCIe x8 grade fast NVME-SSD or use multiple SSDs in striping mode, than normal host-->device data transfer after the buffer copy. If fast_ssd_mode is not 0 , NVME-Strom kicks GPUDirect SQL data transfer regardless of the page cache state. However, it shall never kicks GPUDirect data transfer if page cache is dirty. Note Here is an extra explanation for p2p_dma_max_depth parameter. NVME-Strom Linux kernel module makes DMA requests for GPUDirect SQL data transfer, then enqueues them to I/O-queue of the source NVME devices. When asynchronous DMA requests are enqueued more than the capacity of NVME devices, latency of individual DMA requests become terrible because NVME-SSD controler processes the DMA requests in order of arrival. (On the other hands, it maximizes the throughput because NVME-SSD controler receives DMA requests continuously.) If turn-around time of the DMA requests are too large, it may be wrongly considered as errors, then can lead timeout of I/O request and return an error status. Thus, it makes no sense to enqueue more DMA requests to the I/O-queue more than the reasonable amount of pending requests for full usage of NVME devices. p2p_dma_max_depth parameter controls number of asynchronous P2P DMA requests that can be enqueued at once per NVME device. If application tries to enqueue DMA requests more than the configuration, the caller thread will block until completion of the running DMA. So, it enables to avoid unintentional high-load of NVME devices. NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage is a new feature of CUDA Toolkit version 11.4 which was released at Jun-2021. It also requires installation of OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution (MOFED) driver by Mellanox, for direct read from local NVME-SSD drives or remove NVME-oF devices. You can obtain the MOFED driver from here . The descriptions in this section may not reflect the the latest installation instructions exactly, so please check at the official documentation by NVIDIA also. MOFED Driver Installation You can download the latest MOFED driver from here . This section introduces the example of installation from the tgz archive. Extract the tgz archive, then kick mlnxofedinstall script. Please don't forget the options to enable GPUDirect Storage features. # tar xvf MLNX_OFED_LINUX-5.3-1.0.0.1-rhel8.3-x86_64.tgz # cd MLNX_OFED_LINUX-5.3-1.0.0.1-rhel8.3-x86_64 # ./mlnxofedinstall --with-nvmf --with-nfsrdma --enable-gds --add-kernel-support # dracut -f During the build and installation of MOFED drivers, the installer may require additional packages.

See NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage Installation and Troubleshooting Guide for the details. PostgreSQL Installation This section introduces PostgreSQL installation with RPM. We don't introduce the installation steps from the source because there are many documents for this approach, and there are also various options for the ./configure script. PostgreSQL is also distributed in the packages of Linux distributions, however, it is not the latest one, and often older than the version which supports PG-Strom. For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x or CentOS 7.x distributes PostgreSQL v9.2.x series. This version had been EOL by the PostgreSQL community. PostgreSQL Global Development Group provides yum repository to distribute the latest PostgreSQL and related packages. Like the configuration of EPEL, you can install a small package to set up yum repository, then install PostgreSQL and related software. Here is the list of yum repository definition: http://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php . Repository definitions are per PostgreSQL major version and Linux distribution. You need to choose the one for your Linux distribution, and for PostgreSQL v11 or later. You can install PostgreSQL as following steps: Installation of yum repository definition. Disables the distribution's default PostgreSQL module Only for RHEL8/CentOS8 series Installation of PostgreSQL packages. # dnf install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-8-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm # dnf -y module disable postgresql # dnf install -y postgresql13-devel postgresql13-server Note On the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and CentOS 8, the package name postgresql conflicts to the default one at the distribution, thus, unable to install the packages from PGDG. So, disable the postgresql module by the distribution, using dnf -y module disable postgresql . For the Ret Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and CentOS 7, no need to disable the module because the packages provided by PGDG are identified by the major version. The RPM packages provided by PostgreSQL Global Development Group installs software under the /usr/pgsql-<version> directory, so you may pay attention whether the PATH environment variable is configured appropriately. postgresql-alternative package set up symbolic links to the related commands under /usr/local/bin , so allows to simplify the operations. Also, it enables to switch target version using alternatives command even if multiple version of PostgreSQL. # dnf install postgresql-alternatives PG-Strom Installation RPM Installation PG-Strom and related packages are distributed from HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . If you repository definition has been added, not many tasks are needed. We provide individual RPM packages of PG-Strom for each PostgreSQL major version. pg_strom-PG12 package is built for PostgreSQL v12, and pg_strom-PG13 is also built for PostgreSQL v13. It is a restriction due to binary compatibility of extension modules for PostgreSQL. # dnf install -y pg_strom-PG13 That's all for package installation. Installation from the source For developers, we also introduces the steps to build and install PG-Strom from the source code. Getting the source code Like RPM packages, you can download tarball of the source code from HeteroDB Software Distribution Center . On the other hands, here is a certain time-lags to release the tarball, it may be preferable to checkout the master branch of PG-Strom on GitHub to use the latest development branch. $ git clone https://github.com/heterodb/pg-strom.git Cloning into 'pg-strom'... remote: Counting objects: 13797, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (215/215), done. remote: Total 13797 (delta 208), reused 339 (delta 167), pack-reused 13400 Receiving objects: 100% (13797/13797), 11.81 MiB | 1.76 MiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (10504/10504), done. Building the PG-Strom Configuration to build PG-Strom must match to the target PostgreSQL strictly. For example, if a particular strcut has inconsistent layout by the configuration at build, it may lead problematic bugs; not easy to find out. Thus, not to have inconsistency, PG-Strom does not have own configure script, but references the build configuration of PostgreSQL using pg_config command. If PATH environment variable is set to the pg_config command of the target PostgreSQL, run make and make install . Elsewhere, give PG_CONFIG=... parameter on make command to tell the full path of the pg_config command. $ cd pg-strom $ make PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-13/bin/pg_config $ sudo make install PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-13/bin/pg_config Post Installation Setup Creation of database cluster Database cluster is not constructed yet, run initdb command to set up initial database of PostgreSQL. The default path of the database cluster on RPM installation is /var/lib/pgsql/<version number>/data . If you install postgresql-alternatives package, this default path can be referenced by /var/lib/pgdata regardless of the PostgreSQL version. # su - postgres $ initdb -D /var/lib/pgdata/ The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user \"postgres\". This user must also own the server process. The database cluster will be initialized with locale \"en_US.UTF-8\". The default database encoding has accordingly been set to \"UTF8\". The default text search configuration will be set to \"english\". Data page checksums are disabled. fixing permissions on existing directory /var/lib/pgdata ... ok creating subdirectories ... ok selecting dynamic shared memory implementation ... posix selecting default max_connections ... 100 selecting default shared_buffers ... 128MB selecting default time zone ...

Success. You can now start the database server using: pg_ctl -D /var/lib/pgdata/ -l logfile start Setup postgresql.conf Next, edit postgresql.conf which is a configuration file of PostgreSQL. The parameters below should be edited at least to work PG-Strom. Investigate other parameters according to usage of the system and expected workloads. shared_preload_libraries PG-Strom module must be loaded on startup of the postmaster process by the shared_preload_libraries . Unable to load it on demand. Therefore, you must add the configuration below. shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/pg_strom' max_worker_processes PG-Strom internally uses several background workers, so the default configuration (= 8) is too small for other usage. So, we recommand to expand the variable for a certain margin. max_worker_processes = 100 shared_buffers Although it depends on the workloads, the initial configuration of shared_buffers is too small for the data size where PG-Strom tries to work, thus storage workloads restricts the entire performance, and may be unable to work GPU efficiently. So, we recommend to expand the variable for a certain margin. shared_buffers = 10GB Please consider to apply SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution to process larger than system's physical RAM size. work_mem Although it depends on the workloads, the initial configuration of work_mem is too small to choose the optimal query execution plan on analytic queries. An typical example is, disk-based merge sort may be chosen instead of the in-memory quick-sorting. So, we recommend to expand the variable for a certain margin. work_mem = 1GB Expand OS resource limits GPU Direct SQL especially tries to open many files simultaneously, so resource limit for number of file descriptors per process should be expanded. Also, we recommend not to limit core file size to generate core dump of PostgreSQL certainly on system crash. If PostgreSQL service is launched by systemd, you can put the configurations of resource limit at /etc/systemd/system/postgresql-XX.service.d/pg_strom.conf . RPM installation setups the configuration below by the default. It comments out configuration to the environment variable CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION . This is a developer option that enables to generate GPU's core dump on any CUDA/GPU level errors, if enabled. See CUDA-GDB:GPU core dump support for more details. [Service] LimitNOFILE=65536 LimitCORE=infinity #Environment=CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION=1 Start PostgreSQL Start PostgreSQL service. If PG-Strom is set up appropriately, it writes out log message which shows PG-Strom recognized GPU devices. The example below recognized two NVIDIA A100 (PCIE; 40GB), and displays the closest GPU identifier foe each NVME-SSD drive. # systemctl start postgresql-13 # journalctl -u postgresql-13 -- Logs begin at Thu 2021-05-27 17:02:03 JST, end at Fri 2021-05-28 13:26:35 JST. -- May 28 13:09:33 kujira.heterodb.in systemd[1]: Starting PostgreSQL 13 database server...

There are two individual Linux kernel driver for GPUDirect SQL execution, as follows: HeteroDB NVME-Strom The dedicated Linux kernel module, released at 2018, supported since PG-Strom v2.0. It supports RHEL7.x/RHEL8.x, enables direct read from local NVME-SSDs to GPU using GPUDirect RDMA. NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage The general purpose driver stack, has been developed by NVIDIA, to support direct read from NVME/NVME-oF devices to GPU. At May-2021, its public beta revision has been published. PG-Strom v3.0 experimentally supports the GPUDirect Storage, that supports RHEL8.3/8.4 and Ubuntu 18.04/20.04. Some partners, including HeteroDB, expressed to support this feature. It also allows direct read from shared-filesystems or SDS(Software Defined Storage) devices over NVME-oF protocols.

Note Here is an extra explanation for fast_ssd_mode parameter. When NVME-Strom Linux kernel module get a request for GPUDirect SQL data transfer, first of all, it checks whether the required data blocks are caches on page-caches of operating system. If fast_ssd_mode is 0 , NVME-Strom once writes back page caches of the required data blocks to the userspace buffer of the caller, then indicates application to invoke normal host-->device data transfer by CUDA API. It is suitable for non-fast NVME-SSDs such as PCIe x4 grade. On the other hands, GPUDirect data transfer may be faster, if you use PCIe x8 grade fast NVME-SSD or use multiple SSDs in striping mode, than normal host-->device data transfer after the buffer copy. If fast_ssd_mode is not 0 , NVME-Strom kicks GPUDirect SQL data transfer regardless of the page cache state. However, it shall never kicks GPUDirect data transfer if page cache is dirty. Note Here is an extra explanation for p2p_dma_max_depth parameter. NVME-Strom Linux kernel module makes DMA requests for GPUDirect SQL data transfer, then enqueues them to I/O-queue of the source NVME devices. When asynchronous DMA requests are enqueued more than the capacity of NVME devices, latency of individual DMA requests become terrible because NVME-SSD controler processes the DMA requests in order of arrival. (On the other hands, it maximizes the throughput because NVME-SSD controler receives DMA requests continuously.) If turn-around time of the DMA requests are too large, it may be wrongly considered as errors, then can lead timeout of I/O request and return an error status. Thus, it makes no sense to enqueue more DMA requests to the I/O-queue more than the reasonable amount of pending requests for full usage of NVME devices. p2p_dma_max_depth parameter controls number of asynchronous P2P DMA requests that can be enqueued at once per NVME device. If application tries to enqueue DMA requests more than the configuration, the caller thread will block until completion of the running DMA. So, it enables to avoid unintentional high-load of NVME devices.","title":"heterodb-kmod Installation"},{"location":"install/#nvidia-gpudirect-storage","text":"NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage is a new feature of CUDA Toolkit version 11.4 which was released at Jun-2021.

GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg are implemented on the CustomScan mechanism. In this example, GpuJoin runs JOIN operation on t0 , t1 and t1 , then GpuPreAgg which receives the result of GpuJoin runs GROUP BY operation by the cat column on GPU device. PG-Strom interacts with the query optimizer during PostgreSQL is building a query execution plan, and it offers alternative query execution plan with estimated cost for PostgreSQL's optimizer, if any of SCAN, JOIN, or GROUP BY are executable on GPU device. This estimated cost is better than other query execution plans that run on CPU, it chooses the alternative execution plan that shall run on GPU device. For GPU execution, it requires operators, functions and data types in use must be supported by PG-Strom. It supports numeric types like int or float , date and time types like date or timestamp , variable length string like text and so on. It also supports arithmetic operations, comparison operators and many built-in operators. See References for the detailed list. CPU+GPU Hybrid Parallel PG-Strom also supports PostgreSQL's CPU parallel execution. In the CPU parallel execution mode, Gather node launches several background worker processes, then it gathers the result of \"partial\" execution by individual background workers. CustomScan execution plan provided by PG-Strom, like GpuJoin or GpuPreAgg, support execution at the background workers. They process their partial task using GPU individually. A CPU core usually needs much more time to set up buffer to supply data for GPU than execution of SQL workloads on GPU, so hybrid usage of CPU and GPU parallel can expect higher performance. On the other hands, each process creates CUDA context that is required to communicate GPU and consumes a certain amount of GPU resources, so higher parallelism on CPU-side is not always better. Look at the query execution plan below. Execution plan tree under the Gather is executable on background worker process. It scans t0 table which has 100million rows using four background worker processes and the coordinator process, in other words, 20million rows are handled per process by GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg, then its results are merged at Gather node. # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 GROUP by cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=955705.47..955720.93 rows=27 width=20) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=955705.47..955707.36 rows=756 width=44) Sort Key: t0.cat -> Gather (cost=955589.95..955669.33 rows=756 width=44) Workers Planned: 4 -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=954589.95..954593.73 rows=189 width=44) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on t0 (cost=27682.82..841218.52 rows=99996736 width=12) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Outer Scan: t0 (cost=0.00..1083384.84 rows=24999184 width=8) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 24999184...99996736) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.39MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (18 rows) Pullup underlying plans PG-Strom can run SCAN, JOIN and GROUP BY workloads on GPU, however, it does not work with best performance if these custom execution plan simply replace the standard operations at PostgreSQL. An example of problematic scenario is that SCAN once writes back its result data set to the host buffer then send the same data into GPU again to execute JOIN. Once again, JOIN results are written back and send to GPU to execute GROUP BY. It causes data ping-pong between CPU and GPU. To avoid such inefficient jobs, PG-Strom has a special mode which pulls up its sub-plan to execute a bunch of jobs in a single GPU kernel invocation. Combination of the operations blow can cause pull-up of sub-plans. SCAN + JOIN SCAN + GROUP BY SCAN + JOIN + GROUP BY The execution plan example below never pulls up the sub-plans. GpuJoin receives the result of GpuScan, then its results are passed to GpuPreAgg to generate the final results. # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 WHERE aid < bid GROUP BY cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=1239991.03..1239995.15 rows=27 width=20) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=1239991.03..1239991.50 rows=189 width=44) Sort Key: t0.cat -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=1239980.10..1239983.88 rows=189 width=44) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) (cost=50776.43..1199522.96 rows=33332245 width=12) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 33332245...33332245) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.39MB) -> Custom Scan (GpuScan) on t0 (cost=12634.49..1187710.85 rows=33332245 width=8) GPU Projection: cat, aid GPU Filter: (aid < bid) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (18 rows) This example causes data ping-pong between GPU and host buffers for each execution stage, so not efficient and less performance. On the other hands, the query execution plan below pulls up sub-plans. # EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM t0 NATURAL JOIN t1 WHERE aid < bid GROUP BY cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate (cost=903669.50..903673.62 rows=27 width=20) (actual time=7761.630..7761.644 rows=27 loops=1) Group Key: t0.cat -> Sort (cost=903669.50..903669.97 rows=189 width=44) (actual time=7761.621..7761.626 rows=27 loops=1) Sort Key: t0.cat Sort Method: quicksort Memory: 28kB -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=903658.57..903662.35 rows=189 width=44) (actual time=7761.531..7761.540 rows=27 loops=1) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: cat, pgstrom.nrows(), pgstrom.nrows((ax IS NOT NULL)), pgstrom.psum(ax) Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on t0 (cost=12483.41..863201.43 rows=33332245 width=12) (never executed) GPU Projection: t0.cat, t1.ax Outer Scan: t0 (cost=12634.49..1187710.85 rows=33332245 width=8) (actual time=59.623..5557.052 rows=100000000 loops=1) Outer Scan Filter: (aid < bid) Rows Removed by Outer Scan Filter: 50002874 Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (plan nrows: 33332245...33332245, actual nrows: 49997126...49997126) HashKeys: t0.aid JoinQuals: (t0.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size plan: 10.39MB, exec: 64.00MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1972.85 rows=103785 width=12) (actual time=0.013..15.303 rows=100000 loops=1) Planning time: 0.506 ms Execution time: 8495.391 ms (21 rows) You may notice that SCAN on the table t0 is embedded into GpuJoin, and GpuScan gets vanished. It means GpuJoin pulls up the underlying GpuScan, then combined GPU kernel function is also responsible for evaluation of the supplied WHERE-clause. In addition, here is a strange output in EXPLAIN ANALYZE result - it displays (never executed) for GpuJoin. It means GpuJoin is never executed during the query execution, and it is right. GpuPreAgg pulls up the underlying GpuJoin, then its combined GPU kernel function runs JOIN and GROUP BY. The pg_strom.pullup_outer_scan parameter controls whether SCAN is pulled up, and the pg_strom.pullup_outer_join parameter also controls whether JOIN is pulled up. Both parameters are configured to on . Usually, no need to disable them, however, you can use the parameters to identify the problems on system troubles.

In addition, here is a strange output in EXPLAIN ANALYZE result - it displays (never executed) for GpuJoin. It means GpuJoin is never executed during the query execution, and it is right. GpuPreAgg pulls up the underlying GpuJoin, then its combined GPU kernel function runs JOIN and GROUP BY. The pg_strom.pullup_outer_scan parameter controls whether SCAN is pulled up, and the pg_strom.pullup_outer_join parameter also controls whether JOIN is pulled up. Both parameters are configured to on . Usually, no need to disable them, however, you can use the parameters to identify the problems on system troubles.","title":"Pullup underlying plans"},{"location":"operations/#knowledge-base","text":"We publish several articles, just called \"notes\", on the project wiki-site of PG-Strom. https://github.com/heterodb/pg-strom/wiki","title":"Knowledge base"},{"location":"partition/","text":"Partitioning This chapter introduces the way to use PG-Strom and the partitioning feature of PostgreSQL. Note that this chapter is only valid when PG-Strom works on PostgreSQL v11 or later . Also see PostgreSQL Document: Table Partitioning for more details of the partitioning feature of PostgreSQL. Overview PostgreSQL v10 newly support table partitioning. This mechanism splits one logically large table into physically small pieces. It is valuable because it can skip partitioned child tables which is obviously unnecessary to scan from the search qualification, and it can offer broader I/O bandwidth by physically distributed storage and so on. PostgreSQL v10 supports two kinds of them: range-partitioning and list-partitioning. Then, PostgreSQL v11 newly supports hash-partitioning and partition-wise JOINs. The diagram below shows a range-partitioning configuration with date -type key values. A record which has 2018-05-30 as key is distributed to the partition child table tbl_2018 , in the same way, a record which has 2014-03-21 is distributed to the partition child table tbl_2014 , and so on. In case when scan qualifier WHERE ymd > '2016-07-01'::date is added on scan of the partitioned table for example, it is obvious that tbl_2014 and tbl_2015 contains no records to match, therefore, PostgreSQL' optimizer constructs query execution plan which runs on only tbl_2016 , tbl_2017 and tbl_2018 then merges their results by Append node. It shall perform as if records are read from one logical table. When PG-Strom is used with table partitioning of PostgreSQL together, its optimizer may choose GpuScan to scan the individual partition child tables to be scanned, in the result of cost estimation. In this case, Append node merges the results of GpuScan . On the other hands, if query runs JOIN or GROUP BY, which can be accelerated by PG-Strom, next to the scan on partitioned table, it needs consideration from the standpoint of performance optimization. For example, in case when query scans non-partitioned table then runs JOIN with other tables and GROUP BY, under some conditions, it can handle step-step data exchange on GPU device memory. It is an optimal workload for PG-Strom due to minimized data exchange between GPU and CPU. In case when query runs corresponding workload on the partitioned table, it is problematic that Append node is injected into between the child tables scan and JOIN/GROUP BY. Under the query execution plan, the result of GpuScan must be written back to the host system, then Append merges them and send back the data to GPU to run the following GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg. It is never efficient query execution. The example below shows a query execution plan to the query which includes JOIN and GROUP BY towards the partitioned table pt by the key field ymd of date type; per year distribution. Due to the scan qualification, it omits scan on the partition child tables for 2016 or prior, in addition, a combined JOIN and GROUP BY on the pt_2017 , pt_2018 and pt_2019 shall be executed prior to the Append . # EXPLAIN SELECT cat,count(*),avg(ax) FROM pt NATURAL JOIN t1 WHERE ymd > '2017-01-01'::date GROUP BY cat; QUERY PLAN -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HashAggregate (cost=196410.07..196412.57 rows=200 width=48) Group Key: pt_2017.cat -> Gather (cost=66085.69..196389.07 rows=1200 width=72) Workers Planned: 2 -> Parallel Append (cost=65085.69..195269.07 rows=600 width=72) -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=65085.69..65089.69 rows=200 width=72) Reduction: Local Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on pt_2017 (cost=32296.64..74474.20 rows=1050772 width=40) Outer Scan: pt_2017 (cost=28540.80..66891.11 rows=1050772 width=36) Outer Scan Filter: (ymd > '2017-01-01'::date) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 1050772...2521854) HashKeys: pt_2017.aid JoinQuals: (pt_2017.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.78MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1935.00 rows=100000 width=12) -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=65078.35..65082.35 rows=200 width=72) Reduction: Local Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on pt_2018 (cost=32296.65..74465.75 rows=1050649 width=40) Outer Scan: pt_2018 (cost=28540.81..66883.43 rows=1050649 width=36) Outer Scan Filter: (ymd > '2017-01-01'::date) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 1050649...2521557) HashKeys: pt_2018.aid JoinQuals: (pt_2018.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.78MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1935.00 rows=100000 width=12) -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) (cost=65093.03..65097.03 rows=200 width=72) Reduction: Local Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Parallel Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on pt_2019 (cost=32296.65..74482.64 rows=1050896 width=40) Outer Scan: pt_2019 (cost=28540.80..66898.79 rows=1050896 width=36) Outer Scan Filter: (ymd > '2017-01-01'::date) Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 1050896...2522151) HashKeys: pt_2019.aid JoinQuals: (pt_2019.aid = t1.aid) KDS-Hash (size: 10.78MB) -> Seq Scan on t1 (cost=0.00..1935.00 rows=100000 width=12) (38 rows) Configuration and Operation By the GUC parameters below, PG-Strom enables/disables the push-down of JOIN/GROUP BY under the partition child tables.

PostGIS provides data type ( Geometry ) for handling geographic data such as points, lines, and polygons, as well as a large number of functions and operators for evaluating geographic data elements, such as distance calculation, inclusion, and intersection determination. In addition, some of the operators can search faster by the R-Tree using GiST(Generalized Search Tree) mechanism included in PostgreSQL. Since the first version was released in 2001, it has been enhanced and maintained by the developer community for over 20 years. These functions and operators provided by PostGIS are very large, over 500 in total. For this reason, PG-Strom has ported only a few relatively frequently used PostGIS functions to the GPU. For example: geometry st_point(float8 lon,float8 lat) returns a point with the given longitude and latitude as a Point of Geometry type. bool st_contains(geometry a,geometry b) determines if the geometry a contains the geometry b or not. bool st_crosses(geometry,geometry) determines if the geometries intersect each other. text st_relate(geometry,geometry) returns the relationship between geometries as a matrix representation of DE-9IM(Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model) . PostGIS Usage You can use GPU-PostGIS without any configurations. PG-Strom will automatically determine if the PostGIS functions used in the query are executable on the GPU when PostGIS is installed from the package or the source code and the geometry data types and PostGIS functions are defined using the CREATE EXTENSION syntax. Please refer to the PostGIS documentaion for installation. For example, the following query uses the GPU-executable PostGIS funtion st_contains() and st_makepoint() to determine if a two-dimensional point read from the table is contained within the range of the geometry type constant 'polygon ((10 10,30 10,30 20,10 20,10 10))' . As you can see from the fact that these functions are listed as part of the \"GPU Filter:\", PG-Strom will automatically detect supported PostGIS functions and attempt to run them on the GPU as much as possible. =# explain select * from dpoints where st_contains('polygon ((10 10,30 10,30 20,10 20,10 10))', st_makepoint(x,y)); QUERY PLAN ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Custom Scan (GpuScan) on dpoints (cost=1397205.10..12627630.76 rows=800 width=28) GPU Filter: st_contains('01030000000100000005000000000000000000244000000000000024400000000000003E4000000000000024400000000000003E4000000000000034400000000000002440000000000000344000000000000024400000000000002440'::geometry, st_makepoint(x, y)) GPU Preference: GPU0 (NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB) (3 rows) GiST Index Some of the PostGIS functions that evaluate relationships between geometries, such as st_contains() and st_crosses() , support the GiST index (R-Tree), which enables fast refinement of the search using only the CPU. GpuJoin in PG-Strom sometimes transfers not only the contents of the table but also GiST index (R-Tree) to filter the rows to be joined fast when the join condition between tables can be accelerated. This process is usually executed at a much higher parallelism level than the CPU, so a significant speedup can be expected. On the other hand, GpuScan does not use GiST index to scan a single table. This is because IndexScan filtering by CPU is often faster. The following is an example of a SQL statement to create a GiST index on city boundary data (\"geom\" column of \"giscity\" table). =# CREATE INDEX on giscity USING gist (geom); CREATE INDEX The following is an execution plan of SQL that joins municipal boundary data (\"giscity\" table) and latitude and longitude data (\"dpoints\" table) and outputs the number of latitude and longitude data (points) contained in the area expressed as polygons for each municipality. The optimizer selects GpuJoin, and GpuGiSTJoin to join \"giscity\" table with \"dpoints\" table.

PostGIS provides data type ( Geometry ) for handling geographic data such as points, lines, and polygons, as well as a large number of functions and operators for evaluating geographic data elements, such as distance calculation, inclusion, and intersection determination. In addition, some of the operators can search faster by the R-Tree using GiST(Generalized Search Tree) mechanism included in PostgreSQL. Since the first version was released in 2001, it has been enhanced and maintained by the developer community for over 20 years. These functions and operators provided by PostGIS are very large, over 500 in total. For this reason, PG-Strom has ported only a few relatively frequently used PostGIS functions to the GPU. For example: geometry st_point(float8 lon,float8 lat) returns a point with the given longitude and latitude as a Point of Geometry type. bool st_contains(geometry a,geometry b) determines if the geometry a contains the geometry b or not. bool st_crosses(geometry,geometry) determines if the geometries intersect each other. text st_relate(geometry,geometry) returns the relationship between geometries as a matrix representation of DE-9IM(Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model) .","title":"Overview"},{"location":"postgis/#postgis-usage","text":"You can use GPU-PostGIS without any configurations.

Please refer to the PostGIS documentaion for installation. For example, the following query uses the GPU-executable PostGIS funtion st_contains() and st_makepoint() to determine if a two-dimensional point read from the table is contained within the range of the geometry type constant 'polygon ((10 10,30 10,30 20,10 20,10 10))' .

GpuJoin in PG-Strom sometimes transfers not only the contents of the table but also GiST index (R-Tree) to filter the rows to be joined fast when the join condition between tables can be accelerated. This process is usually executed at a much higher parallelism level than the CPU, so a significant speedup can be expected. On the other hand, GpuScan does not use GiST index to scan a single table. This is because IndexScan filtering by CPU is often faster. The following is an example of a SQL statement to create a GiST index on city boundary data (\"geom\" column of \"giscity\" table). =# CREATE INDEX on giscity USING gist (geom); CREATE INDEX The following is an execution plan of SQL that joins municipal boundary data (\"giscity\" table) and latitude and longitude data (\"dpoints\" table) and outputs the number of latitude and longitude data (points) contained in the area expressed as polygons for each municipality.

Note that aggregated function at GPU mapps numeric data type to double precision floating point values. So, if you are sensitive to calculation errors, you can turn off this configuration to suppress the calculation errors by the operations on CPU. pg_strom.cpu_fallback [type: bool / default: off] Controls whether it actually run CPU fallback operations, if GPU program returned \"CPU ReCheck Error\" pg_strom.regression_test_mode [type: bool / default: off] It disables some EXPLAIN command output that depends on software execution platform, like GPU model name. It avoid \"false-positive\" on the regression test, so use usually don't tough this configuration. Optimizer Configuration pg_strom.chunk_size [type: int / default: 65534kB ] Size of the data blocks processed by a single GPU kernel invocation. It was configurable, but makes less sense, so fixed to about 64MB in the current version. pg_strom.gpu_setup_cost [type: real / default: 4000 ] Cost value for initialization of GPU device pg_strom.gpu_dma_cost [type: real / default: 10 ] Cost value for DMA transfer over PCIe bus per data-chunk ( pg_strom.chunk_size = 64MB) pg_strom.gpu_operator_cost [type: real / default: 0.00015 ] Cost value to process an expression formula on GPU. If larger value than cpu_operator_cost is configured, no chance to choose PG-Strom towards any size of tables Executor Configuration pg_strom.max_async_tasks [type: int / default: 5 ] Max number of asynchronous taks PG-Strom can throw into GPU's execution queue per process. If CPU parallel is used in combination, this limitation shall be applied for each background worker. So, more than pg_strom.max_async_tasks asynchronous tasks are executed in parallel on the entire batch job. pg_strom.reuse_cuda_context [type: bool / default: off ] If on , it tries to reuse CUDA context on the next query execution, already constructed according to the previous query execution. Usually, construction of CUDA context takes 100-200ms, it may improve queries response time, on the other hands, it continue to occupy a part of GPU device memory on the down-side. So, we don't recommend to enable this parameter expect for benchmarking and so on. Also, this configuration makes no sense if query uses CPU parallel execution, because the worker processes shall always construct new CUDA context for each. GPUDirect SQL Configuration pg_strom.gpudirect_driver [type: text ] It shows the driver software name of GPUDirect SQL (read-only). Either nvidia cufile or heterodb nvme-strom pg_strom.gpudirect_enabled [type: bool / default: on ] Enables/disables GPUDirect SQL feature. pg_strom.gpudirect_threshold [type: int / default: auto] Controls the table-size threshold to invoke GPUDirect SQL feature. The default is auto configuration; a threshold calculated by the system physical memory size and shared_buffers configuration. pg_strom.cufile_io_unitsz [type: int / default: 16MB ] Unit size of read-i/o when PG-Strom uses cuFile API. No need to change from the default setting for most cases. It is only available when nvidia cufile driver is used. pg_strom.nvme_distance_map [type: text / default: null ] It manually configures the closest GPU for particular storage evices, like NVME-SSD or NFS volumes. Its format string is {(<gpuX>|<nvmeX>|<sfdvX>|</path/to/nfsmount>),...}[,{...}] . It puts identifiers of GPU and NVME devices within { ... } block to group these devices. (example: {gpu0,nvme1,nvme2,/opt/nfsmount},{gpu1,nvme0} <gpuX> means a GPU with device identifier X. <nvmeX> means a local NVME-SSD or a remote NVME-oF device. <sfdvX> means a special device of CSD drives by ScaleFlux,Inc. /path/to/nfsmount means a mount point by NFS volume with NFS-over-RDMA. Automatic configuration is often sufficient for local NVME-SSD drives, however, you should manually configure the closest GPU for NVME-oF or NFS-over-RDMA volumes. Arrow_Fdw Configuration arrow_fdw.enabled [type: bool / default: on ] By adjustment of estimated cost value, it turns on/off Arrow_Fdw. Note that only Foreign Scan (Arrow_Fdw) can scan on Arrow files, if GpuScan is not capable to run on. arrow_fdw.metadata_cache_size [type: int / default: 128MB ] Size of shared memory to cache metadata of Arrow files. Once consumption of the shared memory exceeds this value, the older metadata shall be released based on LRU. arrow_fdw.record_batch_size [type: int / default: 256MB ] Threshold of RecordBatch when Arrow_Fdw foreign table is written. When total amount of the buffer size exceeds this configuration, Arrow_Fdw writes out the buffer to Apache Arrow file, even if INSERT command is not completed yet. GPU Cache configuration pg_strom.enable_gpucache [type: bool / default: on ] Controls whether search/analytic query tries to use GPU Cache. Note that this parameter does not affect to any writes on the REDO Log buffer by the trigger. pg_strom.gpucache_auto_preload [type: text / default: null ] It specifies the table names to be loaded onto GPU Cache just after PostgreSQL startup. Its format is DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME , and separated by comma if multiple tables are preloaded. Initial-loading of GPU Cache usually takes a lot of time. So, preloading enables to avoid delay of response time of search/analytic queries on the first time. If this parameter is '*', PG-Strom tries to load all the configured tables onto GPU Cache sequentially. HyperLogLog configuration pg_strom.hll_registers_bits [type: int / default: 9 ] It specifies the width of HLL Sketch used for HyperLogLog. PG-Strom allocates 2^pg_strom.hll_registers_bits registers for HLL Sketch, then uses the latest pg_strom.hll_registers_bits bits of hash-values as register selector. It must be configured between 4 and 15. See HyperLogLog for more details of HyperLogLog functionality of PG-Strom. Configuration of GPU code generation and build pg_strom.program_cache_size [type: int / default: 256MB ] Amount of the shared memory size to cache GPU programs already built. It needs restart to update the parameter. pg_strom.num_program_builders [type: int / default: 2 ] Number of background workers to build GPU programs asynchronously. It needs restart to update the parameter. pg_strom.debug_jit_compile_options [type: bool / default: off ] Controls to include debug option (line-numbers and symbol information) on JIT compile of GPU programs. It is valuable for complicated bug analysis using GPU core dump, however, should not be enabled on daily use because of performance degradation. pg_strom.extra_kernel_stack_size [type: int / default: 0 ] Extra size of stack, in bytes, for each GPU kernel thread to be allocated on execution. Usually, no need to change from the default value. GPU Device Configuration pg_strom.cuda_visible_devices [type: text / default: null ] List of GPU device numbers in comma separated, if you want to recognize particular GPUs on PostgreSQL startup. It is equivalent to the environment variable CUDAVISIBLE_DEVICES pg_strom.gpu_memory_segment_size [type: int / default: 512MB ] Specifies the amount of device memory to be allocated per CUDA API call. Larger configuration will reduce the overhead of API calls, but not efficient usage of device memory. PG-Strom shared memory configuration shmbuf.segment_size [type: int / default: 256MB ] It configures the unit length of the shared memory segment that has portable virtual addresses. Usually, it does not need to change the default value, except for the case when GPU Cache uses REDO Log buffer larger than 256MB . In this case, you need to enlarge this parameter also. This parameter allows only power of 2. shmbuf.num_logical_segments [type: int / default: auto] It configures the number of the shared memory segment that has portable virtual addresses. On the system startup, PG-Strom reserves ( shmbuf.segment_size x shmbuf.num_logical_segments ) bytes of virtual address space using mmap(2) with PROT_NONE, then, signal handler allocates physical memory on the demand.

Prerequisites PostgreSQL v9.6, v10 CUDA Toolkit 9.1 Linux distributions supported by CUDA Toolkit Intel x86 64bit architecture (x86_64) NVIDIA GPU CC 6.0 or later (Pascal or Volta) New Features Entire re-design and stabilization of the internal infrastructure to manage GPU device. PostgreSQL backend process simultaneously uses only one GPU at most. In case of multi-GPUs installation, it assumes combination use with CPU parallel execution of PostgreSQL. Usually, it is not a matter because throughput of CPU to provide data to GPU is much narrower than capability of GPU processors. We prioritized simpleness of the software architecture. We began to utilize the demand paging feature of GPU device memory supported at the GPU models since Pascal generation. In most of SQL workloads, we cannot know exact size of the required result buffer prior to its execution, therefore, we had allocated more buffer than estimated buffer length, and retried piece of the workloads if estimated buffer size is not sufficient actually. This design restricts available resources of GPU which can be potentially used for other concurrent processes, and complicated error-retry logic was a nightmare for software quality. The demand paging feature allows to eliminate and simplify these stuffs. We stop to use CUDA asynchronous interface. Use of the demand paging feature on GPU device memory makes asynchronous APIs for DMA (like cuMemCpyHtoD ) perform synchronously, then it reduces concurrency and usage ratio of GPU kernels. Instead of the CUDA asynchronous APIs, PG-Strom manages its own worker threads which call synchronous APIs for each. As a by-product, we also could eliminate asynchronous callbacks ( cuStreamAddCallback ), it allows to use MPS daemon which has a restriction at this API. CPU+GPU Hybrid Parallel Execution CPU parallel execution at PostgreSQL v9.6 is newly supported. CustomScan logic of GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg provided by PG-Strom are executable on multiple background worker processes of PostgreSQL in parallel. Limitation: PG-Strom's own statistics displayed at EXPLAIN ANALYZE if CPU parallel execution. Because PostgreSQL v9.6 does not provide ShutdownCustomScan callback of the CustomScan interface, coordinator process has no way to reclaim information of worker processes prior to the release of DSM (Dynamic Shared Memory) segment. SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution By cooperation with the nvme_strom Linux kernel module, it enables to load PostgreSQL's data blocks on NVMe-SSD to GPU device memory directly, bypassing the CPU and host buffer. This feature enables to apply PG-Strom on the area which have to process large data set more than system RAM size. It allows to pull out pretty high throughput close to the hardware limitation because its data stream skips block-device or filesystem layer. Then, GPU runs SQL workloads that usually reduce the amount of data to be processed by CPU. The chemical reaction of these characteristics enables to redefine GPU's role as accelerator of I/O workloads also, not only computing intensive workloads. In-memory Columnar Cache For middle size data-set loadable onto the system RAM, it allows to cache data-blocks in column format which is more suitable for GPU computing. If cached data-blocks are found during table scan, PG-Strom prefers to reference the columnar cache more than shared buffer of PostgreSQL. In-memory columnar cache can be built synchronously, or asynchronously by the background workers. You may remember very early revision of PG-Strom had similar feature. In case when a cached tuple gets updated, the latest in-memory columnar cache which we newly implemented in v2.0 invalidates the cache block which includes the updated tuples. It never updates the columnar cache according to the updates of row-store, so performance degradation is quite limited. GPU Memory Store (gstore_fdw) It enables to write to / read from preserved GPU device memory region by SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE in SQL-level, using foreign table interface. In v2.0, only pgstrom internal data format is supported. It saves written data using PG-Strom's buffer format of KDS_FORMAT_COLUMN . It can compress variable length data using LZ algorithm. In v2.0, GPU memory store can be used as data source of PL/CUDA user defined function. Redesign and performance improvement of GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg Stop using Dynamic Parallelism which we internally used in GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg, and revised entire logic of these operations. Old design had a problem of less GPU usage ratio because a GPU kernel which launches GPU sub-kernel and just waits for its completion occupied GPU's execution slot. A coproduct of this redesign is suspend/resume of GpuJoin. In principle, JOIN operation of SQL may generate larger number of rows than number of input rows, but preliminary not predictive. The new design allows to suspend GPU kernel once buffer available space gets lacked, then resume with new result buffer. It simplifies size estimation logic of the result buffer, and eliminates GPU kernel retry by lack of buffer on run-time. GpuPreAgg+GpuJoin+GpuScan combined GPU kernel In case when GPU executable SCAN, JOIN and GROUP BY are serially cascaded, a single GPU kernel invocation runs a series of tasks equivalent to the GpuScan, GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg. This is an approach to minimize data exchange between CPU and GPU. For example, result buffer of GpuJoin is used as input buffer of GpuPreAgg. This feature is especially valuable if combined with SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution. PL/CUDA Enhancement #plcuda_include is enhanced to specify SQL function which returns text type. It can change the code block to inject according to the argument, so it also allows to generate multiple GPU kernel variations, not only inclusion of externally defined functions. If PL/CUDA takes reggstore type argument, GPU kernel function receives pointer of the GPU memory store. Note that it does not pass the OID value. Other Enhancement lo_import_gpu and lo_export_gpu functions allows to import contents of the GPU device memory acquired by external applications directly, or export contents of the largeobject to the GPU device memory. Packaging Add RPM packages to follow the PostgreSQL packages distributed by PostgreSQL Global Development Group. All the software packages are available at HeteroDB SWDC(Software Distribution Center) and downloadable. Document PG-Strom documentation was entirely rewritten using markdown and mkdocs. It makes documentation maintenance easier than the previous HTML based approach, so expects timely updates according to the development of new features. Test Regression test for PG-Strom was built on top of the regression test framework of PostgreSQL. Dropped features PostgreSQL v9.5 Support PostgreSQL v9.6 had big changes in both of the optimizer and executor to support CPU parallel query execution. The biggest change for extension modules that interact them is an enhancement of the interface called \"upper planner path-ification\". It allows to choose an optimal execution-plan from the multiple candidates based on the estimated cost, even if it is aggregation or sorting. It is fundamentally different from the older way where we rewrote query execution plan to inject GpuPreAgg using the hooks. It allows to inject GpuPreAgg node in more reasonable and reliable way, and we could drop complicated (and buggy) logic to rewrite query execution plan once constructed. CustomScan interface is also enhanced to support CPU parallel execution. Due to the reason, we dropped PostgreSQL v9.5 support to follow these new enhancement. GpuSort feature We dropped GpuSort because we have little advantages in the performance. Sorting is one of the GPU suitable workloads. However, in case when we try to sort data blocks larger than GPU device memory, we have to split the data blocks into multiple chunks, then partially sort them and merge them by CPU to generate final results. Larger chunk size is better to reduce the load to merge multiple chunks by CPU, on the other hands, larger chunk size takes larger lead time to launch GPU kernel to sort. It means here is a trade-off; which disallows asynchronous processing by PG-Strom to make data transfer latency invisible. It is hard to solve the problem, or too early to solve the problem, we dropped GpuSort feature once.","title":"PG-Strom v2.0"},{"location":"release_v2.0/#pg-strom-v20-release","text":"PG-Strom Development Team (17-Apr-2018)","title":"PG-Strom v2.0 Release"},{"location":"release_v2.0/#overview","text":"Major enhancement in PG-Strom v2.0 includes: Overall redesign of the internal infrastructure to manage GPU and stabilization CPU+GPU hybrid parallel execution SSD-to-GPU Direct SQL Execution In-memory columnar cache GPU memory store (gstore_fdw) Redesign of GpuJoin and GpuPreAgg and speed-up GpuPreAgg + GpuJoin + GpuScan combined GPU kernel You can download the summary of new features from: PG-Strom v2.0 Technical Brief .","title":"Overview"},{"location":"release_v2.0/#prerequisites","text":"PostgreSQL v9.6, v10 CUDA Toolkit 9.1 Linux distributions supported by CUDA Toolkit Intel x86 64bit architecture (x86_64) NVIDIA GPU CC 6.0 or later (Pascal or Volta)","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"release_v2.0/#new-features","text":"Entire re-design and stabilization of the internal infrastructure to manage GPU device. PostgreSQL backend process simultaneously uses only one GPU at most. In case of multi-GPUs installation, it assumes combination use with CPU parallel execution of PostgreSQL. Usually, it is not a matter because throughput of CPU to provide data to GPU is much narrower than capability of GPU processors. We prioritized simpleness of the software architecture. We began to utilize the demand paging feature of GPU device memory supported at the GPU models since Pascal generation. In most of SQL workloads, we cannot know exact size of the required result buffer prior to its execution, therefore, we had allocated more buffer than estimated buffer length, and retried piece of the workloads if estimated buffer size is not sufficient actually. This design restricts available resources of GPU which can be potentially used for other concurrent processes, and complicated error-retry logic was a nightmare for software quality. The demand paging feature allows to eliminate and simplify these stuffs. We stop to use CUDA asynchronous interface. Use of the demand paging feature on GPU device memory makes asynchronous APIs for DMA (like cuMemCpyHtoD ) perform synchronously, then it reduces concurrency and usage ratio of GPU kernels. Instead of the CUDA asynchronous APIs, PG-Strom manages its own worker threads which call synchronous APIs for each. As a by-product, we also could eliminate asynchronous callbacks ( cuStreamAddCallback ), it allows to use MPS daemon which has a restriction at this API.

Several PostGIS functions are executable on GPUs. GpuJoin using GiST index is now supported. GPU Cache mechanism is newly implemented. User-defined GPU data types/functions/operators are experimentally supported. Software license was switched from GPLv2 to PostgreSQL license. Prerequisites PostgreSQL v11, v12, v13 CUDA Toolkit 11.2 or later Linux distributions supported by CUDA Toolkit Intel x86 64bit architecture (x86_64) NVIDIA GPU CC 6.0 or later (Pascal or newer) NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage GPUDirect Storage , has been developed by NVIDIA, is now supported as a driver for GPU Direct SQL , in addition to the existing nvme_strom kernel module. Both of drivers have almost equivalent functionalities and performance, but supports of GPUDirect Storage enables P2P direct read from NVME-oF (NVME over Fabrics) devices, SDS (Software Defined Storage) devices and shared filesystem built on these devices. Therefore, it offers larger and more flexible storage configuration. We can use GPUDirect SQL to scan PostgreSQL's heap table and Apache Arrow files. It can expect significant performance improvement for the workloads where table scans are the major bottleneck, in either driver cases. The performance measurement below is by SSBM (Star Schema Benchmark) using 1xGPU and 4xNVME-SSDs under the GPUDirect Storage driver. It shows number of rows processed per unit time is significantly improved regardless of the storage system; either PostgreSQL heap or Apache Arrow. In comparison of the read throughput from NVME-SSD drives during the query execution, it shows the table scan by GPUDirect Storage pulls out almost optimal performance close to the hardware limitation, much faster than the scan by filesystem (PostgreSQL Heap Storage). GPU-PostGIS and GiST-index We have implemented GPU versions of several PostGIS functions. When these PostGIS functions are used in qualifier clauses (like, WHERE-clause), PG-Strom will automatically generate a GPU program to execute it on the GPU. The main target of GPU version of PostGIS is the workload to check the real-time location data of mobile devices, like smartphones or vehicles, against the area definition data like boundary of municipality or school districts. For example, when you want to deliver an advertisement to smartphonws in a particular area, or when you want to deliver traffic jam information to cara in a particular area, it is effective in the process of searching for the corresponding device using the position as a key. In the following example, it creates 16 million random points data in a rectangular area that includes the Tokyo region, then count up number of the points contained in the cities in Tokyo for each. The vanilla PostGIS and GiST index took more than 160sec, on the other hand, GPU-version of PostGIS and GiST index responded in 0.830 sec. GPU Cache GPU Cache mechanism can store a copy of the target table in a pre-allocated area on the GPU device memory. It was designed for efficient execution of analytical/search queries on frequently updated data with relatively small data size (~10GB). The GPU can process SQL workloads by referring to GPU Cache instead of loading data from tables when executing analytical/search queries. This is typically a workload that keeps real-time data from millions of devices on the GPU and frequently updates timestamps and location information. When the table with GPU cache is updated, the update history is stored in the on-memory redo log buffer, then applied to the GPU cache at a regular intervals or before executing the analysis / search workload. By this mechanism, it achieved both of frequent updates and consistency of GPU cache. User-defined GPU datatype/functions A new API is provided to add user-defined GPU data types/functions.

Processor will run idle if data stream would not be delivered. GPUDirect SQL Execution directly connects NVMe-SSD which enables high-speed I/O processing by direct attach to the PCIe bus and GPU device that is also attached on the same PCIe bus, and runs SQL workloads very high speed by supplying data stream close to the wired speed of the hardware. Usually, PostgreSQL data blocks on the storage shall be once loaded to CPU/RAM through the PCIe bus, then, PostgreSQL runs WHERE-clause for filtering or JOIN/GROUP BY according to the query execution plan. Due to the characteristics of analytic workloads, the amount of result data set is much smaller than the source data set. For example, it is not rare case to read billions rows but output just hundreds rows after the aggregation operations with GROUP BY. In the other words, we consume bandwidth of the PCIe bus to move junk data, however, we cannot determine whether rows are necessary or not prior to the evaluation by SQL workloads on CPU. So, it is not avoidable restriction in usual implementation. GPU Direct SQL Execution changes the flow to read blocks from the storage sequentially. It directly loads data blocks to GPU using peer-to-peer DMA over PCIe bus, then runs SQL workloads on GPU device to reduce number of rows to be processed by CPU. In other words, it utilizes GPU as a pre-processor of SQL which locates in the middle of the storage and CPU/RAM for reduction of CPU's load, then tries to accelerate I/O processing in the results. This feature internally uses either of NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage module or NVME-Strom module (if RHEL7/CentOS7), that is a Linux kernel module originally designed by HeteroDB, to coordinate P2P data transfer from NVME storage to GPU device memory. So, this feature requires either of the above Linux kernel modules, in addition to PG-Strom as an extension of PostgreSQL. Also note that this feature supports only NVME-SSD or NVME-oF remove devices. It does not support legacy storages like SAS or SATA-SSD. We have tested several NVMD-SSD models. You can refer 002: HW Validation List for your information. System Setup Driver Installation When PG-Strom is used on a RHEL7/CentOS7 platform, for existing PG-Strom systems in other words, GPUDirect SQL Execution requires NVME-Strom driver by HeteroDB. See the (\"Install\" -> \"heterodb-kmod Installation\")[../install/#heterodb-kmod] of this manual for more details. Note GPUDirect SQL by NVME-Strom driver supports only local NVME-SSD drives. We experimentally provide a driver for NVME-oF devices, but don't recommend to use in commercial systems. For usage of PG-Strom on the platform other than RHEL7/CentOS7, for newly installed PG-Strom systems in other words, GPUDirect SQL Execution requires NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage. It also requires to install the MOFED(Mellanox Open Fabrics Enterprise Distribution) driver with support of GPUDirect Storage, in addition to the GPUDirect Storage module itself. See the (\u300c\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u300d\u21d2\u300cNVIDIA GPUDirect Storage\u300d)[../install/#nvidia-gpudirect-storage] of this manual for more details. Designing Tablespace GPU Direct SQL Execution shall be invoked in the following case. The target table to be scanned locates on the partition being consist of NVMe-SSD. /dev/nvmeXXXX block device, or md-raid0 volume which consists of NVMe-SSDs only. The target table size is larger than pg_strom.nvme_strom_threshold . You can adjust this configuration. Its default is physical RAM size of the system plus 1/3 of shared_buffers configuration. Note Striped read from multiple NVMe-SSD using md-raid0 requires the enterprise subscription provided by HeteroDB,Inc. In order to deploy the tables on the partition consists of NVMe-SSD, you can use the tablespace function of PostgreSQL to specify particular tables or databases to place them on NVMe-SSD volume, in addition to construction of the entire database cluster on the NVMe-SSD volume. For example, you can create a new tablespace below, if NVMe-SSD is mounted at /opt/nvme . CREATE TABLESPACE my_nvme LOCATION '/opt/nvme'; In order to create a new table on the tablespace, specify the TABLESPACE option at the CREATE TABLE command below. CREATE TABLE my_table (...) TABLESPACE my_nvme; Or, use ALTER DATABASE command as follows, to change the default tablespace of the database. Note that tablespace of the existing tables are not changed in thie case. ALTER DATABASE my_database SET TABLESPACE my_nvme; Operations Distance between GPU and NVME-SSD On selection of server hardware and installation of GPU and NVME-SSD, hardware configuration needs to pay attention to the distance between devices, to pull out maximum performance of the device. NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA , basis of the GPU Direct SQL mechanism, requires both of the edge devices of P2P DMA are connected on the same PCIe root complex. In the other words, unable to configure the P2P DMA traverses QPI between CPUs when NVME-SSD is attached on CPU1 and GPU is attached on CPU2 at dual socket system. From standpoint of the performance, it is recommended to use dedicated PCIe-switch to connect both of the devices more than the PCIe controller built in CPU. The photo below is a motherboard of HPC server. It has 8 of PCIe x16 slots, and each pair is linked to the other over the PCIe switch. The slots in the left-side of the photo are connected to CPU1, and right-side are connected to CPU2. When a table on SSD-2 is scanned using GPU Direct SQL, the optimal GPU choice is GPU-2, and it may be able to use GPU1. However, we have to avoid to choose GPU-3 and GPU-4 due to the restriction of GPUDirect RDMA. PG-Strom calculate logical distances on any pairs of GPU and NVME-SSD using PCIe bus topology information of the system on startup time. It is displayed at the start up log. Each NVME-SSD determines the preferable GPU based on the distance, for example, GPU1 shall be used on scan of the /dev/nvme2 . $ pg_ctl restart : LOG: GPU<->SSD Distance Matrix LOG: GPU0 GPU1 GPU2 LOG: nvme0 ( 3) 7 7 LOG: nvme5 7 7 ( 3) LOG: nvme4 7 7 ( 3) LOG: nvme2 7 ( 3) 7 LOG: nvme1 ( 3) 7 7 LOG: nvme3 7 ( 3) 7 : Usually automatic configuration works well. In case when NVME-over-Fabric(RDMA) is used, unable to identify the location of nvme device on the PCIe-bus, so you need to configure the logical distance between NVME-SSD and GPU manually. The example below shows the configuration of gpu2 for nvme1 , and gpu1 for nvme2 and nvme3 . It shall be added to postgresql.conf . Please note than manual configuration takes priority than the automatic configuration. pg_strom.nvme_distance_map = '{nvme1,gpu2},{nvme2,nvme3,gpu1}' Controls using GUC parameters There are two GPU parameters related to GPU Direct SQL Execution. The first is pg_strom.gpudirect_enabled that simply turn on/off the function of GPU Direct SQL Execution. If off , GPU Direct SQL Execution should not be used regardless of the table size or physical location. Default is on . The other one is pg_strom.nvme_strom_threshold which specifies the least table size to invoke GPU Direct SQL Execution. PG-Strom will choose GPU Direct SQL Execution when target table is located on NVME-SSD volume (or md-raid0 volume which consists of NVME-SSD only), and the table size is larger than this parameter. Its default configuration is sum of the physical memory size and 1/3 of the shared_buffers . It means default configuration invokes GPU Direct SQL Execution only for the tables where we certainly cannot process them on memory. Even if GPU Direct SQL Execution has advantages on a single table scan workload, usage of disk cache may work better on the second or later trial for the tables which are available to load onto the main memory. On course, this assumption is not always right depending on the workload charasteristics. Ensure usage of GPU Direct SQL Execution EXPLAIN command allows to ensure whether GPU Direct SQL Execution shall be used in the target query, or not. In the example below, a scan on the lineorder table by Custom Scan (GpuJoin) shows NVMe-Strom: enabled . In this case, GPU Direct SQL Execution shall be used to read from the lineorder table. # explain (costs off) select sum(lo_revenue), d_year, p_brand1 from lineorder, date1, part, supplier where lo_orderdate = d_datekey and lo_partkey = p_partkey and lo_suppkey = s_suppkey and p_category = 'MFGR#12' and s_region = 'AMERICA' group by d_year, p_brand1 order by d_year, p_brand1; QUERY PLAN ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GroupAggregate Group Key: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1 -> Sort Sort Key: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1 -> Custom Scan (GpuPreAgg) Reduction: Local GPU Projection: pgstrom.psum((lo_revenue)::double precision), d_year, p_brand1 Combined GpuJoin: enabled -> Custom Scan (GpuJoin) on lineorder GPU Projection: date1.d_year, part.p_brand1, lineorder.lo_revenue Outer Scan: lineorder Depth 1: GpuHashJoin (nrows 2406009600...97764190) HashKeys: lineorder.lo_partkey JoinQuals: (lineorder.lo_partkey = part.p_partkey) KDS-Hash (size: 10.67MB) Depth 2: GpuHashJoin (nrows 97764190...18544060) HashKeys: lineorder.lo_suppkey JoinQuals: (lineorder.lo_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey) KDS-Hash (size: 131.59MB) Depth 3: GpuHashJoin (nrows 18544060...18544060) HashKeys: lineorder.lo_orderdate JoinQuals: (lineorder.lo_orderdate = date1.d_datekey) KDS-Hash (size: 461.89KB) NVMe-Strom: enabled -> Custom Scan (GpuScan) on part GPU Projection: p_brand1, p_partkey GPU Filter: (p_category = 'MFGR#12'::bpchar) -> Custom Scan (GpuScan) on supplier GPU Projection: s_suppkey GPU Filter: (s_region = 'AMERICA'::bpchar) -> Seq Scan on date1 (31 rows) Attension for visibility map Right now, GPU routines of PG-Strom cannot run MVCC visibility checks per row, because only host code has a special data structure for visibility checks. It also leads a problem. We cannot know which row is visible, or invisible at the time when PG-Strom requires P2P DMA for NVMe-SSD, because contents of the storage blocks are not yet loaded to CPU/RAM, and MVCC related attributes are written with individual records. PostgreSQL had similar problem when it supports IndexOnlyScan. To address the problem, PostgreSQL has an infrastructure of visibility map which is a bunch of flags to indicate whether any records in a particular data block are visible from all the transactions. If associated bit is set, we can know the associated block has no invisible records without reading the block itself. GPU Direct SQL Execution utilizes this infrastructure. It checks the visibility map first, then only \"all-visible\" blocks are required to read with P2P DMA. VACUUM constructs visibility map, so you can enforce PostgreSQL to construct visibility map by explicit launch of VACUUM command.

This session introduces the way to collect crash dump of the PostgreSQL and PG-Strom process (CPU side) and PG-Strom's GPU kernel, and show the back trace on the serious problems. Add configuration on PostgreSQL startup For generation of crash dump (CPU-side) on process crash, you need to change the resource limitation of the operating system for size of core file PostgreSQL server process can generate. For generation of crash dump (GPU-size) on errors of GPU kernel, PostgreSQL server process has CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION environment variable, and its value has 1 . You can put a configuration file at /etc/systemd/system/postgresql-<version>.service.d/ when PostgreSQL is kicked by systemd. In case of RPM installation, a configuration file pg_strom.conf is also installed on the directory, and contains the following initial configuration. [Service] LimitNOFILE=65536 LimitCORE=infinity #Environment=CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION=1 In CUDA 9.1, it usually takes more than several minutes to generate crash dump of GPU kernel, and it entirely stops response of the PostgreSQL session which causes an error. So, we recommend to set CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION environment variable only if you investigate errors of GPU kernels which happen on a certain query.
